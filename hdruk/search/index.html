Several aspects of chronic pain, for example back pain and a severity-related phenotype 'chronic pain grade', have been shown previously to be complex heritable traits with a polygenic component. Additional pain-related phenotypes capturing aspects of an individual's overall sensitivity to experiencing and reporting chronic pain have also been suggested as a focus for investigation. We made use of a measure of the number of sites of chronic pain in individuals within the UK general population. This measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is a complex trait and its genetic architecture has not previously been investigated. To address this, we carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MCP in ~380,000 UK Biobank participants. Our findings were consistent with MCP having a significant polygenic component, with a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) heritability of 10.2%. In total 76 independent lead SNPs at 39 risk loci were associated with MCP. Additional gene-level association analyses identified neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis genes as enriched for genetic association with MCP. Genetic correlations were observed between MCP and a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and anthropometric traits, including major depressive disorder (MDD), asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI). Furthermore, in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses a causal effect of MCP on MDD was observed. Additionally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MCP was found to significantly predict chronic widespread pain (pain all over the body), indicating the existence of genetic variants contributing to both of these pain phenotypes. Overall, our findings support the proposition that chronic pain involves a strong nervous system component with implications for our understanding of the physiology of chronic pain.

We aimed to measure the incidence, prevalence, and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for TBI and SCI from all causes of injury in every country, to describe how these measures have changed between 1990 and 2016, and to estimate the proportion of TBI and SCI cases caused by different types of injury.', 'We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2016 to measure the global, regional, and national burden of TBI and SCI by age and sex. We measured the incidence and prevalence of all causes of injury requiring medical care in inpatient and outpatient records, literature studies, and survey data. By use of clinical record data, we estimated the proportion of each cause of injury that required medical care that would result in TBI or SCI being considered as the nature of injury. We used literature studies to establish standardised mortality ratios and applied differential equations to convert incidence to prevalence of long-term disability. Finally, we applied GBD disability weights to calculate YLDs. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool for epidemiological modelling, used cause-specific mortality rates for non-fatal estimation, and adjusted our results for disability experienced with comorbid conditions. We also analysed results on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index, a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility.', 'In 2016, there were 27\u00b708 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 24\u00b730-30\u00b730 million) new cases of TBI and 0\u00b793 million (0\u00b778-1\u00b716 million) new cases of SCI, with age-standardised incidence rates of 369 (331-412) per 100\\u2008000 population for TBI and 13 (11-16) per 100\\u2008000 for SCI.

From 1990 to 2016, the age-standardised prevalence of TBI increased by 8\u00b74% (95% UI 7\u00b77 to 9\u00b72), whereas that of SCI did not change significantly (-0\u00b72% [-2\u00b71 to 2\u00b77]). Age-standardised incidence rates increased by 3\u00b76% (1\u00b78 to 5\u00b75) for TBI, but did not change significantly for SCI (-3\u00b76% [-7\u00b74 to 4\u00b70]).

Falls and road injuries were the leading causes of new cases of TBI and SCI in most regions.', 'TBI and SCI constitute a considerable portion of the global injury burden and are caused primarily by falls and road injuries. The increase in incidence of TBI over time might continue in view of increases in population density, population ageing, and increasing use of motor vehicles, motorcycles, and bicycles. The number of individuals living with SCI is expected to increase in view of population growth, which is concerning because of the specialised care that people with SCI can require. Our study was limited by data sparsity in some regions, and it will be important to invest greater resources in collection of data for TBI and SCI to improve the accuracy of future assessments.',

With effort underway to convert narrative character descriptions to computable data, ontologies for such modifiers are needed. Such ontologies can also be used to guide term usage in future publications. Spatial and method modifiers are the subjects of ontologies that already have been developed or are under development. In this work, frequency (e.g., rarely, usually), certainty (e.g., probably, definitely), degree (e.g., slightly, extremely), and coverage modifiers (e.g., sparsely, entirely) are collected, reviewed, and used to create two modifier ontologies with different design considerations. The basic goal is to express the sequential relationships within a type of modifiers, for example, usually is more frequent than rarely, in order to allow data annotated with ontology terms to be classified accordingly. &lt;i&gt;Method:&lt;/i&gt; Two designs are proposed for the ontology, both using the list pattern: a closed ordered list (i.e., five-bin design) and an open ordered list design. The five-bin design puts the modifier terms into a set of 5 fixed bins with interval object properties, for example, one_level_more/less_frequently_than, where new terms can only be added as synonyms to existing classes. The open list approach starts with 5 bins, but supports the extensibility of the list via ordinal properties, for example, more/less_frequently_than, allowing new terms to be inserted as a new class anywhere in the list. The consequences of the different design decisions are discussed in the paper. CharaParser was used to extract modifiers from plant, ant, and other taxonomic descriptions. After a manual screening, 130 modifier words were selected as the candidate terms for the modifier ontologies. Four curators/experts (three biologists and one information scientist specialized in biosemantics) reviewed and categorized the terms into 20 bins using the Ontology Term Organizer (OTO) (http://biosemantics.arizona.edu/OTO). Inter-curator variations were reviewed and expressed in the final ontologies. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Frequency, certainty, degree, and coverage terms with complete agreement among all curators were used as class labels or exact synonyms. Terms with different interpretations were either excluded or included using \"broader synonym\" or \"not recommended\" annotation properties. These annotations explicitly allow for the user to be aware of the semantic ambiguity associated with the terms and whether they should be used with caution or avoided. Expert categorization results showed that 16 out of 20 bins contained terms with full agreements, suggesting differentiating the modifiers into 5 levels/bins balances the need to differentiate modifiers and the need for the ontology to reflect user consensus. Two ontologies, developed using the Protege ontology editor, are made available as OWL files and can be downloaded from https://github.com/biosemantics/ontologies. &lt;i&gt;Contribution:&lt;/i&gt; We built the first two modifier ontologies following a consensus-based approach with terms commonly used in taxonomic literature. The five-bin ontology has been used in the Explorer of Taxon Concepts web toolkit to compute the similarity between characters extracted from literature to facilitate taxon concepts alignments. The two ontologies will also be used in an ontology-informed authoring tool for taxonomists to facilitate consistency in modifier term usage.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Endara L"}, {"clean": "Thessen A"}, {"clean": "Cole H"}, {"clean": "Walls R"}, {"clean": "Gkoutos G"}, {"clean": "Cao Y"}, {"clean": "Chong S"}, {"clean": "Cui H"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Biodivers Data J", "volume": "", "issue": "6"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "5SISMY49", "DOI": "10.3233/JAD-181085", "DOI_filename": "e6a191014ffb825822896c5c8a75e630", "PMID": "30909231", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85064861422", "hash": "fe8731d2e25461ed8fbcb356099beece"}, "clean": {"title": "A Meta-Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Brain Transcriptomic Data.", "abstract": "[\"Microarray technologies have identified imbalances in the expression of specific genes and biological pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains.

The ability to detect the majority of at-risk individuals is the main barrier toward extending benefits for the lives of many adolescents and young adults. Current detection strategies are highly inefficient. Only 5% (standalone specialized early detection services) to 12% (youth mental health services) of individuals who will develop a first psychotic disorder can be detected at the time of their at-risk stage. To overcome these challenges a pragmatic, clinically-based, individualized, transdiagnostic risk calculator has been developed to detect individuals at-risk of psychosis in secondary mental health care at scale. This calculator has been externally validated and has demonstrated good prognostic performance. However, it is not known whether it can be used in the real world clinical routine. For example, clinicians may not be willing to adhere to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk calculator. Implementation studies are needed to address pragmatic challenges relating to the real world use of the transdiagnostic risk calculator. The aim of the current study is to provide &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; feasibility data to support the implementation of the transdiagnostic risk calculator in clinical routine. &lt;b&gt;Method:&lt;/b&gt; This is a study which comprises of two subsequent phases: an &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; phase of 1 month and an &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; phase of 11 months.

The &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; phase aims at addressing the clinicians' adherence to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk calculator (primary outcome) and other secondary feasibility parameters that are necessary to estimate the resources needed for its implementation. &lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; This is the first implementation study for risk prediction models in individuals at-risk for psychosis. Ultimately, successful implementation is the true measure of a prediction model's utility. Therefore, the overall translational deliverable of the current study would be to extend the benefits of primary indicated prevention and improve outcomes of first episode psychosis.

However, this characterisation remains incomplete and the non-obvious features of this topology have largely confounded attempts towards comprehensive constructive modelling. This calls for new perspectives. Hierarchical complexity is an emerging paradigm of complex network topology based on the observation that complex systems are composed of hierarchies within which the roles of hierarchically equivalent nodes display highly variable connectivity patterns. Here we test the hierarchical complexity of the human structural connectomes of a group of seventy-nine healthy adults. Binary connectomes are found to be more hierarchically complex than three benchmark random network models. This provides a new key description of brain structure, revealing a rich diversity of connectivity patterns within hierarchically equivalent nodes. Dividing the connectomes into four tiers based on degree magnitudes indicates that the most complex nodes are neither those with the highest nor lowest degrees but are instead found in the middle tiers. Spatial mapping of the brain regions in each hierarchical tier reveals consistency with the current anatomical, functional and neuropsychological knowledge of the human brain. The most complex tier (Tier 3) involves regions believed to bridge high-order cognitive (Tier 1) and low-order sensorimotor processing (Tier 2). We then show that such diversity of connectivity patterns aligns with the diversity of functional roles played out across the brain, demonstrating that hierarchical complexity can characterise functional diversity strictly from the network topology.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Brain", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Connectome", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Nerve Net", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Neural Pathways", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Smith K"}, {"clean": "Bastin M"}, {"clean": "Cox S"}, {"clean": "Vald\u00e9s Hern\u00e1ndez M"}, {"clean": "Wiseman S"}, {"clean": "Escudero J"}, {"clean": "Sudlow C"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Neuroimage", "volume": "191", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "76S4PBDR", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbi.2019.05.009", "DOI_filename": "fb47cb9d3b7f385511c64e361a44b136", "PMID": "31063847", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85065596053", "hash": "1177e3a40536527a07f479def6e6daf9"}, "clean": {"title": "Transcriptomic analysis of probable asymptomatic and symptomatic alzheimer brains.", "abstract": "['Individuals with intact cognition and neuropathology consistent with Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) are referred to as asymptomatic AD (AsymAD).

The data of 45 drugs were analyzed and their interactions with selected pharmacogenes were estimated. Frequency of actionable genotypes of 249 Dutch parents was obtained from the public database: Genome of Netherlands (GoNL), to identify the pattern of genetic characteristics of Dutch population.', 'Over a 7 year period, 51.3 million exposures of patients to PGX drugs were reported with an average of 5.3 exposures per each drug user. One quarterof the exposures (12.4 million) are predicted to be experienced by individuals with actionable genotypes (risky exposures). Up to 60% of the risky exposures (around 7.5 million) were related to drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. SLCO1B1, and CYP2C19 were also identified among the top genes affecting response of drugs users (involved in about 22 and 12.4% of the risky exposures, respectively). Cardiovascular medications were the top prescribed PGX drug class (43%), followed by gastroenterology (29%) and psychiatry/neurology medications (15%). Women use more PGX drugs than men (55.8 vs. 44.2%, respectively) with the majority (84%) of users in both sexes are above 45 years.', \"PGX drugs are commonly used in Netherlands. Preemptive panel testing for CYP2D6, SLCO1B1, and CYP2C19 only could be useful to predict 95% of vulnerable patients' exposures to PGX drugs. Future studies to assess the economic impact of preemptive panel testing on patients of older age are suggested.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Alshabeeb M"}, {"clean": "Deneer V"}, {"clean": "Khan A"}, {"clean": "Asselbergs F"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Front Genet", "volume": "10", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "8MYKRN7P", "DOI": "10.1016/j.injury.2019.05.004", "DOI_filename": "c6771eda92ec832ddf4a45fd9588e30b", "PMID": "31109684", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85065624582", "hash": "a77bdc9edfa9f866daeab0986e695592"}, "clean": {"title": "Agreement between medical record and administrative coding of common comorbidities in orthopaedic trauma patients.", "abstract": "['To i) quantify the agreement between comorbidities documented within medical records and an orthopaedic trauma dataset; and ii) compare agreement between these sources before and after the introduction of new comorbidity coding rules in Australian hospitals.', \"A random sample of adult (\u2265 16 years) orthopaedic trauma patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009400) were extracted from the Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR).

We aimed to identify and describe existing prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in children and adults in primary care. We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, TRIP and US National Guidelines Clearinghouse databases from 1 January 1990 to 23 November 17.

Patient-reported wheeze, symptom variability and history of allergy or allergic rhinitis were associated with asthma. In conclusion, clinical prediction models may support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care, but existing models are at high risk of bias and thus unreliable for informing practice.

It is difficult to discover such interactions using existing approaches. The purpose of our work is to develop and evaluate a system that can identify combinations of alleles underlying digenic and oligogenic diseases in individual whole exome or whole genome sequences. Information that links patient phenotypes to databases of gene-phenotype associations observed in clinical or non-human model organism research can provide useful information and improve variant prioritization for genetic diseases. Additional background knowledge about interactions between genes can be utilized to identify sets of variants in different genes in the same individual which may then contribute to the overall disease phenotype. We have developed OligoPVP, an algorithm that can be used to prioritize causative combinations of variants in digenic and oligogenic diseases, using whole exome or whole genome sequences together with patient phenotypes as input. We demonstrate that OligoPVP has significantly improved performance when compared to state of the art pathogenicity detection methods in the case of digenic diseases. Our results show that OligoPVP can efficiently prioritize sets of variants in digenic diseases using a phenotype-driven approach and identify etiologically important variants in whole genomes. OligoPVP naturally extends to oligogenic disease involving interactions between variants in two or more genes. It can be applied to the identification of multiple interacting candidate variants contributing to phenotype, where the action of modifier genes is suspected from pedigree analysis or failure of traditional causative variant identification.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Computational Biology", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Association Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genomics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Multifactorial Inheritance", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Boudellioua I"}, {"clean": "Kulmanov M"}, {"clean": "Schofield P"}, {"clean": "Gkoutos G"}, {"clean": "Hoehndorf R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Sci Rep", "volume": "8", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "GENKGBH2", "DOI": "10.1186/s12911-019-0805-0", "DOI_filename": "292596eea4f8679bcf39b8eea755c311", "PMID": "30999919", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85064522657", "hash": "c1514408d83e3fb73ff3c74d1a72e1bc"}, "clean": {"title": "Identifying clinically important COPD sub-types using data-driven approaches in primary care population based electronic health records.", "abstract": "['COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease composed of different phenotypes with different aetiological and prognostic profiles and current classification systems do not fully capture this heterogeneity.

The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders.', \"We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach.\", \"Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247-308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9\u00b70 million [8\u00b78-9\u00b74]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34-44] and DALYs by 15% [9-21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26-30] and DALYs by 27% [24-31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42\u00b72% [38\u00b76-46\u00b71]), migraine (16\u00b73% [11\u00b77-20\u00b78]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10\u00b74% [9\u00b70-12\u00b71]), and meningitis (7\u00b79% [6\u00b76-10\u00b74]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1\u00b712 [1\u00b705-1\u00b720]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0\u00b77. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88\u00b78% (86\u00b75-90\u00b79) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22\u00b73% [11\u00b78-35\u00b71] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14\u00b71% [10\u00b78-17\u00b75] of DALYs are risk attributable).\", 'Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.', 'Bill & Melinda

Disease Study 2016.", "abstract": "['Previous studies have reported national and regional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates for the UK. Because of substantial variation in health within the UK, action to improve it requires comparable estimates of disease burden and risks at country and local levels. The slowdown in the rate of improvement in life expectancy requires further investigation. We use GBD 2016 data on mortality, causes of death, and disability to analyse the burden of disease in the countries of the UK and within local authorities in England by deprivation quintile.', 'We extracted data from the GBD 2016 to estimate years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and attributable risks from 1990 to 2016 for England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the UK, and 150 English Upper-Tier Local Authorities. We estimated the burden of disease by cause of death, condition, year, and sex. We analysed the association between burden of disease and socioeconomic deprivation using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We present results for all 264 GBD causes of death combined and the leading 20 specific causes, and all 84 GBD risks or risk clusters combined and 17 specific risks or risk clusters.', \"The leading causes of age-adjusted YLLs in all UK countries in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, lung cancers, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Age-standardised rates of YLLs for all causes varied by two times between local areas in England according to levels of socioeconomic deprivation (from 14\\u2008274 per 100\\u2008000 population [95% uncertainty interval 12\\u2008791-15\\u2008875] in Blackpool to 6888 [6145-7739] in Wokingham). Some Upper-Tier Local Authorities, particularly those in London, did better than expected for their level of deprivation. Allowing for differences in age structure, more deprived Upper-Tier Local Authorities had higher attributable YLLs for most major risk factors in the GBD. The population attributable fractions for all-cause YLLs for individual major risk factors varied across Upper-Tier Local Authorities. Life expectancy and YLLs have improved more slowly since 2010 in all UK countries compared with 1990-2010. In nine of 150 Upper-Tier Local Authorities, YLLs increased after 2010. For attributable YLLs, the rate of improvement slowed most substantially for cardiovascular disease and breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, and showed little change for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Morbidity makes an increasing contribution to overall burden in the UK compared with mortality. The age-standardised UK DALY rate for low back and neck pain (1795 [1258-2356]) was higher than for ischaemic heart disease (1200 [1155-1246]) or lung cancer (660 [642-679]). The leading causes of ill health (measured through YLDs) in the UK in 2016 were low back and neck pain, skin and subcutaneous diseases, migraine, depressive disorders, and sense organ disease. Age-standardised YLD rates varied much less than equivalent YLL rates across the UK, which reflects the relative scarcity of local data on causes of ill health.\", 'These estimates at local, regional, and national level will allow policy makers to match resources and priorities to levels of burden and risk factors.

These data may be produced during routine clinical processes or obtained directly from the patient using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Although efficiency and other reasons justify data availability for a range of potentially relevant uses, these data are nearly always collected for a single specific purpose. The health care literature reflects this narrow scope, and there is limited literature on the joint use of health data for daily clinical use, clinical research, surveillance, and administrative purposes. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework for discussing the efficient use of health data with a specific focus on the role of PRO measures. PRO data may be used at an individual patient level to inform patient care or shared decision making and to tailor care to individual needs or group-level needs as a complement to health record data, such as that on mortality and readmission, in order to inform service delivery and measure the real-world effectiveness of treatment. PRO measures may be used either for their own sake, to provide valuable information from the patient perspective, or as a proxy for clinical data that would otherwise not be feasible to collect. We introduce a framework to analyze any health care activity that involves health data. The framework consists of four data processes (patient identification, data collection, data aggregation and data use), further structured into two dichotomous dimensions in each data process (level: group vs patient; timeframe: ad hoc vs systematic). This framework is used to analyze various health activities with respect to joint use of data, considering the technical, legal, organizational, and logistical challenges that characterize each data process. Finally, we propose a model for joint use of health data with data collected during follow-up as a base. Demands for health data will continue to increase, which will further add to the need for the concerted use and reuse of PRO data for parallel purposes. Repeated and uncoordinated PRO data collection for the same patient for different purposes results in misuse of resources for the patient and the health care system as well as reduced response rates owing to questionnaire fatigue. PRO data can be routinely collected both at the hospital (from inpatients as well as outpatients) and outside of hospital settings; in primary or social care settings; or in the patient's home, provided the health informatics infrastructure is in place. In the future, clinical settings are likely to be a prominent source of PRO data; however, we are also likely to see increased remote collection of PRO data by patients in their own home (telePRO). Data collection for research and quality surveillance will have to adapt to this circumstance and adopt complementary data capture methods that take advantage of the utility of PRO data collected during daily clinical practice. The European Union's regulation with respect to the protection of personal data-General Data Protection Regulation-imposes severe restrictions on the use of health data for parallel purposes, and steps should be taken to alleviate the consequences while still protecting personal data against misuse.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Data Collection", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medical Informatics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medical Records Systems, Computerized", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Physician-Patient Relations", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Hjollund N"}, {"clean": "Valderas J"}, {"clean": "Kyte D"}, {"clean": "Calvert M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J.

Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic.

Using CA-PLS, we find that some previously reported differences are actually associated with external factors and discover a number of previously unreported biomarkers linked to different metabolic pathways.

Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of these instruments was performed on 424,439 European individuals (54% female) in the UK Biobank who were aged 40-69 years when recruited from 2006 to 2010, with their genetic data linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from April, 1995 to March, 2016. Two-sample summary data mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate the effect of varying iron status on outcomes across the human phenome. MR-PheWAS analysis for the 3 iron status genetic instruments was performed separately and then pooled by meta-analysis. Correction was made for testing of multiple correlated phenotypes using a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Heterogeneity between MR estimates for different instruments was used to indicate possible bias due to effects of the genetic variants through pathways unrelated to iron status. There were 904 distinct phenotypes included in the MR-PheWAS analyses. After correcting for multiple testing, the 3 genetic instruments for systemic iron status demonstrated consistent evidence of a causal effect of higher iron status on decreasing risk of traits related to anemia (iron deficiency anemia: odds ratio [OR] scaled to a standard deviation [SD] increase in genetically determined serum iron levels 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.81, P = 4 \u00d7 10-8) and hypercholesterolemia (hypercholesterolemia: OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, P = 2 \u00d7 10-5) and increasing risk of traits related to infection of the skin and related structures (cellulitis and abscess of the leg: OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.42, P = 6 \u00d7 10-4). The main limitations of this study relate to possible bias from pleiotropic effects of the considered genetic variants and misclassification of diagnoses in the HES data. Furthermore, this work only investigated participants with European ancestry, and the findings may not be applicable to other ethnic groups.', 'Our findings offer novel, to our knowledge, insight into previously unreported effects of iron status, highlighting a potential protective effect of higher iron status on hypercholesterolemia and a detrimental role on risk of skin and skin structure infections.

The pulsatile nature of blood flow through the carotid arteries induces a subtle head vibration. This vibration is a potential indicator of carotid stenosis severity, and it is exploited in the present study. A head vibration model has been proposed in the present work that is linked to the forces generated by blood flow with or without occlusion. The model is used to generate a large number of virtual head vibration data for different degrees of occlusion. In order to determine the in vivo head vibration, a computer vision algorithm is adopted to use human face videos. The in vivo vibrations are compared against the virtual vibration data generated from the coupled computational blood flow/vibration model. A comparison of the in vivo vibration is made against the virtual data to find the best fit between in vivo and virtual data.

The SNOMED CT nomenclature potentially offers the means to model such information at scale, yet given a sufficiently large body of clinical text collected over many years, it is difficult to identify the language that clinicians favour to express concepts. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; By utilising a large corpus of healthcare data, we sought to make use of semantic modelling and clustering techniques to represent the relationship between the clinical vocabulary of internationally recognised SMI symptoms and the preferred language used by clinicians within a care setting. We explore how such models can be used for discovering novel vocabulary relevant to the task of phenotyping Serious Mental Illness (SMI) with only a small amount of prior knowledge.\\xa0 &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; 20 403 terms were derived and curated via a two stage methodology. The list was reduced to 557 putative concepts based on eliminating redundant information content. These were then organised into 9 distinct categories pertaining to different aspects of psychiatric assessment. 235 concepts were found to be expressions of putative clinical significance. Of these, 53 were identified having novel synonymy with existing SNOMED CT concepts. 106 had no mapping to SNOMED CT. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate a scalable approach to discovering new concepts of SMI symptomatology based on real-world clinical observation. Such approaches may offer the opportunity to consider broader manifestations of SMI symptomatology than is typically assessed via current diagnostic frameworks, and create the potential for enhancing nomenclatures such as SNOMED CT based on real-world expressions.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Jackson R"}, {"clean": "Patel R"}, {"clean": "Velupillai S"}, {"clean": "Gkotsis G"}, {"clean": "Hoyle D"}, {"clean": "Stewart R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "F1000Res", "volume": "7", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "V4RU8PHT", "DOI": "10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023232", "DOI_filename": "b3345af095bb09abe58074ddac170b16", "PMID": "30940752", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85063898957", "hash": "45061a2cc879227245864c2aae9a1ef4"}, "clean": {"title": "Using natural language processing to extract structured epilepsy data from unstructured clinic letters: development and validation of the ExECT (extraction of epilepsy clinical text) system.", "abstract": "['Routinely collected healthcare data are a powerful research resource but often lack detailed disease-specific information that is collected in clinical free text, for example, clinic letters.

With our comprehensive approach to health accounting within the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older.', 'Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol consumption, along with 592 prospective and retrospective studies on the risk of alcohol use, we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking, abstention, the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily (defined as 10 g of pure ethyl alcohol), and alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs. We made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health.', 'Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALYs in 2016, accounting for 2\u00b72% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1\u00b75-3\u00b70) of age-standardised female deaths and 6\u00b78% (5\u00b78-8\u00b70) of age-standardised male deaths.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system reduces the risk of kidney disease progression and treatments that lower blood pressure (BP) or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk in this population. Nevertheless, despite such interventions, considerable risks for kidney and CV complications remain. Recently, large placebo-controlled outcome trials have shown that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduce the risk of CV disease (including CV death and hospitalization for heart failure) in people with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk of atherosclerotic disease, and these effects were largely independent of improvements in hyperglycaemia, BP and body weight. In the kidney, increased sodium delivery to the macula densa mediated by SGLT-2 inhibition has the potential to reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may explain why SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce albuminuria and appear to slow kidney function decline in people with diabetes. Importantly, in the trials completed to date, these benefits appeared to be maintained at lower levels of kidney function, despite attenuation of glycosuric effects, and did not appear to be dependent on ambient hyperglycaemia. There is therefore a rationale for studying the cardio-renal effects of SGLT-2 inhibition in people at risk of CV disease and hyperfiltration (i.e. those with substantially reduced nephron mass and/or albuminuria), irrespective of whether they have diabetes.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Herrington W"}, {"clean": "Preiss D"}, {"clean": "Haynes R"}, {"clean": "von Eynatten M"}, {"clean": "Staplin N"}, {"clean": "Hauske S"}, {"clean": "George J"}, {"clean": "Green J"}, {"clean": "Landray M"}, {"clean": "Baigent C"}, {"clean": "Wanner C"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Clin Kidney J", "volume": "11", "issue": "6"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "YSWR6EFC", "DOI": "10.4193/Rhin18.237", "DOI_filename": "d8a8e1d1974035885e63bada5771d734", "PMID": "30928998", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85071067376", "hash": "baa87992c4dc02177c26b388d7a693de"}, "clean": {"title": "Risk of mortality and cardiovascular events following macrolide prescription in chronic rhinosinusitis patients: a cohort study using linked primary care electronic health records.", "abstract": "['Macrolide antibiotics have demonstrated important anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients.
