We describe several techniques to reduce this bias and estimate corrected standard errors. We present our findings using a simulation study and an empirical application. For the latter, we estimate the effect of height on lung function, using genetic variants as instruments for height. Our simulation study demonstrates that, using many weak individual variants, two-stage least squares (2SLS) is biased, whereas the limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) and the continuously updating estimator (CUE) are unbiased and have accurate rejection frequencies when standard errors are corrected for the presence of many weak instruments. Our illustrative empirical example uses data on 3631 children from England. We used 180 genetic variants as instruments and compared conventional ordinary least squares estimates with results for the 2SLS, LIML, and CUE instrumental variable estimators using the individual height variants. We further compare these with instrumental variable estimates using an unweighted or weighted allele score as single instruments. In conclusion, the allele scores and CUE gave consistent estimates of the causal effect. In our empirical example, estimates using the allele score were more efficient. CUE with corrected standard errors, however, provides a useful additional statistical tool in applications with many weak instruments. The CUE may be preferred over an allele score if the population weights for the allele score are unknown or when the causal effects of multiple risk factors are estimated jointly.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Alleles", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Bias", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Body Height", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Causality", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Computer Simulation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "England", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Variation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Least-Squares Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Likelihood Functions", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Linear Models", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mendelian Randomization Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Random Allocation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Vital Capacity", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Davies N"}, {"clean": "von Hinke Kessler Scholder S"}, {"clean": "Farbmacher H"}, {"clean": "Burgess S"}, {"clean": "Windmeijer F"}, {"clean": "Smith G"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Stat Med", "volume": "34", "issue": "3"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "24C7W4DG", "DOI": "10.1210/jc.2003-031848", "DOI_filename": "3c58c22c29dec4dfc839d4107f3d813b", "PMID": "15181036", "scopus": "2-s2.0-2942633569", "hash": "6f8b07b389cad7cc116a114fcd848307"}, "clean": {"title": "Opposing influences of prenatal and postnatal weight gain on adrenarche in normal boys and girls.", "abstract": "['Associations between low birth weight and higher adrenal androgen secretion before puberty have yet only been reported in case-control studies in girls. We examined the influence of birth weight and early postnatal weight gain on overnight-fasting adrenal androgen and cortisol levels in 770 children from a large normal United Kingdom birth cohort at age 8 yr. In univariate analyses, adrenal androgen levels were inversely related to birth weight sd score in each sex [dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in boys: regression coefficient (B) = -2.5 microg/dl/SD; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.7 to -0.2; in girls: B = -3.8 microg/dl/SD; 95% CI, -6.2 to -1.4; androstenedione in boys: B = -0.15 nmol/liter/sd, 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.6; in girls: B = -0.13 nmol/liter/SD; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.02). In multivariate analyses, both lower birth weight and larger current body weight predicted higher adrenal androgen levels (P &lt; 0.005 for all comparisons).

In contrast, cortisol levels were unrelated to birth weight or current body size. In summary, the relationship between lower birth weight and higher childhood adrenal androgen levels was continuous throughout the range of normal birth weights, and was similar in boys and girls.

However, through its predominant focus on nonparametric identification, the causal inference approach to effect decomposition via natural effects is limited to settings that exclude intermediate confounders. Such confounders are naturally dealt with (albeit with the caveats of informality and modeling inflexibility) in the SEM framework. Therefore, it seems pertinent to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and (parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference. Here we investigate: 1) how identification assumptions affect the specification of SEMs, 2) whether the more restrictive SEM assumptions can be relaxed, and 3) whether existing sensitivity analyses can be extended to this setting.

Utilizing longitudinal data in the United Kingdom birth cohort studies, we investigated shifts over the past nearly 70 years in the distribution of body mass index (BMI) and development of overweight or obesity across childhood and adulthood.', 'The sample comprised 56,632 participants with 273,843 BMI observations in the 1946 Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD; ages 2-64 years), 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS; 7-50), 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS; 10-42), 1991 Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; 7-18), or 2001 Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; 3-11). Growth references showed a secular trend toward positive skewing of the BMI distribution at younger ages. During childhood, the 50th centiles for all studies lay in the middle of the International Obesity Task Force normal weight range, but during adulthood, the age when a 50th centile first entered the overweight range (i.e., 25-29.9 kg/m2) decreased across NSHD, NCDS, and BCS from 41 to 33 to 30 years in males and 48 to 44 to 41 years in females. Trajectories of overweight or obesity showed that more recently born cohorts developed greater probabilities of overweight or obesity at younger ages. Overweight or obesity became more probable in NCDS than NSHD in early adulthood, but more probable in BCS than NCDS and NSHD in adolescence, for example. By age 10 years, the estimated probabilities of overweight or obesity in cohorts born after the 1980s were 2-3 times greater than those born before the 1980s (e.g., 0.229 [95% CI 0.219-0.240] in MCS males; 0.071 [0.065-0.078] in NSHD males). It was not possible to (1) model separate trajectories for overweight and obesity, because there were few obesity cases at young ages in the earliest-born cohorts, or (2) consider ethnic minority groups. The end date for analyses was August 2014.', 'Our results demonstrate how younger generations are likely to accumulate greater exposure to overweight or obesity throughout their lives and, thus, increased risk for chronic health conditions such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

We related maternal self-reports of prenatal stress to childhood gender role behavior in a prospective, population study of 13,998 pregnancies resulting in 14,138 offspring. Neither stress reported during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy nor stress reported from week 19 of pregnancy to week 8 postnatal related to gender role behavior in male offspring at the age of 42 months. In female offspring, maternal reports of stress during both periods showed only small correlations with masculine-typical behavior. Although this relationship remained significant when other factors that related to stress were controlled, these other factors made larger contributions to girls' gender role behavior than did prenatal stress. In addition, in both boys and girls, older male or female siblings, parental adherence to traditional sex roles, maternal use of tobacco or alcohol during pregnancy, and maternal education all related significantly to gender role behavior.

In particular, variants at CPED1 exerted a larger influence on SK-BMD and UL-BMD when compared to LL-BMD (P = 2.01 \u00d7 10(-37)), whilst variants at WNT16 influenced UL-BMD to a greater degree when compared to SK- and LL-BMD (P = 2.31 \u00d7 10(-14)).

The study aims to continue to collect detailed data on the children as they go through puberty noting, in particular, changes in anthropometry, attitudes and behaviour, fitness and other cardiovascular risk factors, bone mineralisation, allergic symptoms and mental health. The study started early during pregnancy and collected very detailed data from the mother and her partner before the child was born. This not only provided accurate data on concurrent features, especially medication, symptoms, diet and lifestyle, attitudes and behaviour, social and environmental features, but was unbiased by parental knowledge of any problems that the child might develop. From the time of the child's birth many different aspects of the child's environment have been monitored and a wide range of phenotypic data collected. By virtue of being based in one geographic area, linkage to medical and educational records is relatively simple, and hands-on assessments of children and parents using local facilities has the advantage of high quality control. The comprehensiveness of the ALSPAC approach with a total population sample unselected by disease status, and the availability of parental genotypes, provides an adequate sample for statistical analysis and for avoiding spurious results.

However, gene variants identified to date explain less than 10% of the variance in refractive error, leaving the majority of heritability unexplained (\"missing heritability\"). Previously, we reported that expression of APLP2 was strongly associated with myopia in a primate model. Here, we found that low-frequency variants near the 5\\'-end of APLP2 were associated with refractive error in a prospective UK birth cohort (n = 3,819 children; top SNP rs188663068, p = 5.0 \u00d7 10-4) and a CREAM consortium panel (n = 45,756 adults; top SNP rs7127037, p = 6.6 \u00d7 10-3). These variants showed evidence of differential effect on childhood longitudinal refractive error trajectories depending on time spent reading (gene x time spent reading x age interaction, p = 4.0 \u00d7 10-3). Furthermore, Aplp2 knockout mice developed high degrees of hyperopia (+11.5 \u00b1 2.2 D, p &lt; 1.0 \u00d7 10-4) compared to both heterozygous (-0.8 \u00b1 2.0 D, p &lt; 1.0 \u00d7 10-4) and wild-type (+0.3 \u00b1 2.2 D, p &lt; 1.0 \u00d7 10-4) littermates and exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in susceptibility to environmentally induced myopia (F(2, 33) = 191.0, p &lt; 1.0 \u00d7 10-4).

This work identifies APLP2 as one of the \"missing\" myopia genes, demonstrating the importance of a low-frequency gene variant in the development of human myopia.

When examining harmful levels of alcohol use, baseline levels of depressive symptoms in males were weakly related to later harmful alcohol use but this association was attenuated substantially through adjustment for confounders. In contrast, both baseline symptoms and increase in symptoms were associated with later harmful alcohol use in females and these associations were not diminished by confounder adjustment. Elevated depressive symptoms during adolescence are positively associated with increases in both use and harmful use of alcohol at 18 years 8 months. These findings differ between the sexes.

Few researchers have, however, quantitatively assessed how siblings may influence indicators of mental health, where it is conceivable that social interactions with siblings may have a positive influence. Here, using data from a large British cohort survey (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), we explored the effects of sibling configuration on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, as a multidimensional index for mental health problems. We demonstrate a significant socio-economic gradient in mental health between the ages of three and nine years, but little evidence for negative effects of large sibship size. Rerunning this analysis to examine birth order, a much clearer pattern emerged; the presence of older siblings was associated with relatively good mental health, while the presence of younger siblings was associated with relatively poor mental health. This suggests that being born into a large family, providing the child is not joined by subsequent siblings, may carry important benefits unconsidered by past research.

In this manuscript we investigate the effect of sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy on longitudinal DNA methylation in their offspring using a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model. This model avoids the data reduction used in previous analyses. Four of the 28 previously identified, smoking related CpG sites were shown to have offspring methylation related to maternal smoking using this method, replicating findings in well-known smoking related genes MYO1G and GFI1. Further weak associations were found at the AHRR and CYP1A1 loci.

Daily servings of F&V (&gt;1 v. \u22641 serving/d, except in Generation XXI: &gt;3 v. \u22643) and the Healthy Plate Variety Score (categorised by the median score of each sample) were calculated using FFQ.

Studies of contemporary populations indicate that rapid infancy weight gain, which may follow fetal growth restriction, is an important risk factor for the development of childhood obesity and insulin resistance. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood shows that rapid catch-up weight gain can lead to the development of insulin resistance, as early as 1 year of age, in association with increasing accumulation of central abdominal fat mass. In contrast, the disposition index, which reflects the beta-cells ability to maintain insulin secretion in the face of increasing insulin resistance, is much more closely related to ponderal index at birth than postnatal catch-up weight gain. Infants with the lowest ponderal index at birth show a reduced disposition index at aged 8 years associated with increases in fasting NEFA levels. The disposition index is also closely related to childhood height gain and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels; reduced insulin secretory capacity being associated with reduced statural growth, and relatively short stature with reduced IGF-I levels at age 8 years. IGF-I may have an important role in the maintenance of beta-cell mass, as demonstrated by recent studies of pancreatic beta-cell IGF-I receptor knock-out and adult observational studies indicating that low IGF-I levels are predictive of subsequent risk for the development of type 2 diabetes. However, as insulin secretion is an important determinant of IGF-I levels, cause and effect may be difficult to establish. In conclusion, although rapid infancy weight gain and increasing rates of childhood obesity will increase the risk for the development of insulin resistance, prenatal and postnatal determinants of beta-cell mass may ultimately be the most important determinants of an individual's ability to maintain insulin secretion in the face of increasing insulin resistance, and thus risk for the development of type 2 diabetes.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Birth Weight", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant, Newborn", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Insulin", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Insulin Resistance", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Insulin Secretion", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Obesity", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pregnancy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Weight Gain", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Dunger D"}, {"clean": "Salgin B"}, {"clean": "Ong K"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Proc Nutr Soc", "volume": "66", "issue": "3"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "5Q9J5CBN", "DOI": "10.1093/ije/dyv077", "DOI_filename": "8a123f78f771290bffb224da59a0e005", "PMID": "25953783", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84936747479", "hash": "f92ccc99c555cba7bf9aa5def1e21913"}, "clean": {"title": "A genome-wide association study of body mass index across early life and childhood.", "abstract": "['Several studies have investigated the effect of known adult body mass index (BMI) associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on BMI in childhood.

The study sample comprised 7056 girls from a large UK birth cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) who provided data on age at onset of menarche and depressive symptoms assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire at 14 years.

The findings suggest that early age at menarche is one of the pathways linking early childhood father absence and depressive symptoms in mid-adolescent girls.

Consequently, if preferences for facial symmetry do represent an evolved adaptation, then they probably function not to provide marginal fitness benefits by choosing between relatively healthy individuals on the basis of small differences in FA, but rather evolved to motivate avoidance of markers of substantial developmental disturbance and significant pathology.

In light of these findings, we genotyped a further 3692 individuals from ALSPAC who had whole body BMD and confirmed the association in children as well (P = 5.4 x 10(-5)). Moreover, all SNPs were related to height in ALSPAC children, but not weight or body mass index, and when height was included as a covariate in the regression equation, the association with total body BMD was attenuated.

We examined this question using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort by investigating relationships between circulating adiponectin levels at a mean age of 9.9 years, indices of bone mass as measured by total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at ages 9.9 and 15.5 years, and cortical bone parameters as measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) of the midtibia at age 15.5 years. A total of 4927 children were included at age 9.9 years, of whom 97% and 90% of boys and girls, respectively, were in prepuberty or early puberty, as defined by Tanner stage 1-2. A total of 2754 children were included at age 15.5 years, of whom 95% and 97% of boys and girls, respectively, were in late puberty, as defined by Tanner stage 4-5. Circulating adiponectin was found to be related to fat mass, lean mass, and, to a lesser extent, height, so analyses were adjusted for these three variables to identify possible independent effects of adiponectin on bone development. Adiponectin was inversely related to total-body-less-head bone mineral content (BMC; -3.0%), bone area (BA; -1.8%), BMC divided by BA (BMD; -4.8%), and BMC adjusted for BA by linear regression (aBMC; -5.6%), as measured at age 9.9 years (coefficients show change per doubling in adiponectin concentration, p\\u2009&lt;\\u2009.001).

Further pQCT results suggested that this inverse association of adiponectin with skeletal development predominantly involved a negative association with endosteal relative to periosteal expansion, as reflected by cortical thickness (-6.0%, p\\u2009&lt;\\u2009.001). We conclude that, independent of fat mass, lean mass, and height, adiponectin is associated with lower bone mass in childhood predominantly owing to an influence on relative endosteal expansion.

The proportion of mothers breast-feeding in the 4th week after birth was higher for slow weight gainers, but they were more likely to switch to formula at the start of recovery. During recovery, slow-weight gain infants had a slightly higher energy intake from formula and solids than controls. In conclusion, feeding problems seem to be the most important factors associated with the onset of early slow weight gain. Subsequently, a reduction of feeding problems and an increase in overall energy intake may contribute to their weight recovery.

We tested 667 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 15 previously reported candidate genes for intelligence and 29451 SNPs in five genomic loci previously identified through whole genome linkage and association analyses. Significant SNPs were tested in four independent samples (4,357 subjects), one ascertained for ADHD, and three population-based samples. Associations between intelligence and SNPs in the ATXN1 and TRIM31 genes and in three genomic locations showed replicated association, but only in the samples ascertained for ADHD, suggesting that these genetic variants become particularly relevant to IQ on the background of a psychiatric disorder.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Ataxin-1", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Ataxins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "European Continental Ancestry Group", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Intelligence", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Nuclear Family", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Nuclear Proteins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Phenotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Tripartite Motif Proteins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Rizzi T"}, {"clean": "Arias-Vasquez A"}, {"clean": "Rommelse N"}, {"clean": "Kuntsi J"}, {"clean": "Anney R"}, {"clean": "Asherson P"}, {"clean": "Buitelaar J"}, {"clean": "Banaschewski T"}, {"clean": "Ebstein R"}, {"clean": "Ruano D"}, {"clean": "Van der Sluis S"}, {"clean": "Markunas C"}, {"clean": "Garrett M"}, {"clean": "Ashley-Koch A"}, {"clean": "Kollins S"}, {"clean": "Anastopoulos A"}, {"clean": "Hansell N"}, {"clean": "Wright M"}, {"clean": "Montgomery G"}, {"clean": "Martin N"}, {"clean": "Harris S"}, {"clean": "Davies G"}, {"clean": "Tenesa A"}, {"clean": "Porteous D"}, {"clean": "Starr J"}, {"clean": "Deary I"}, {"clean": "St Pourcain B"}, {"clean": "Davey Smith G"}, {"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "Evans D"}, {"clean": "Gill M"}, {"clean": "Miranda A"}, {"clean": "Mulas F"}, {"clean": "Oades R"}, {"clean": "Roeyers H"}, {"clean": "Rothenberger A"}, {"clean": "Sergeant J"}, {"clean": "Sonuga-Barke E"}, {"clean": "Steinhausen H"}, {"clean": "Taylor E"}, {"clean": "Faraone S"}, {"clean": "Franke B"}, {"clean": "Posthuma D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Am.

To investigate whether normal variation in leptin and insulin levels in cord blood could influence infancy growth, we assayed samples from 197 infants from a representative birth cohort, who were measured at birth, 4, 8, 12 and 24 months. Cord leptin levels correlated most closely with weight and ponderal index (kg/m3) at birth, but also with length and head circumference (all p&lt;0.0005). Independent of birth size, females had higher leptin levels than males (p&lt;0.0005). Cord levels of leptin, but not insulin, were negatively related to weight gain (p&lt;0.005) from birth to 4 months, and accounted for 9.4% of the variance in weight gain, compared with breast/bottle feeding (3.5%) and early/late introduction of solids (1%). The effect of leptin levels on weight gain was independent of birthweight, and was still evident at 24 months. The wide variation in infancy growth ('catch-up' or 'catch-down') may be partly determined by leptin levels preset in utero.

The sample was 719 lone mothers and a comparison group of 8779 women with partners drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). Data collected by self completion questionnaire at 33 months postpartum provided information about average weekly take home family income and the mother's employment status. The health outcomes measured were general well being, both minor and major depression (using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), self report of respiratory symptoms (cough/cold, wheeze, influenza) from 18-33 months postpartum and self report of symptoms common in the childbearing years (backache, haemorrhoids) also from 18-33 months postpartum. Lone mothers who were not employed were the poorest group in the sample; 94% of this group (402) had a family income of less than pound sterling 200 per week, compared with 72% (188) of lone mothers who were employed, 25% (905) of partnered women who were not employed and 12% (466) of partnered women who were employed.

The recent identification of common genetic variants related to obesity in children provides an opportunity to implement a Mendelian randomization study of obesity and bone outcomes, which is less subject to confounding and several biases than conventional approaches. Genotyping was retrieved for variants of two loci reliably associated with adiposity (the fat mass and obesity-related gene FTO and that upstream of the MC4R locus) within 7470 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who had undergone total body DXA scans at a mean of 9.9 yr. Relationships between both fat mass/genotypes and bone measures were assessed in efforts to determine evidence of causality between adiposity and bone mass. In conventional tests of association, both with and without height adjustment, total fat mass was strongly related to total body, spinal, and upper and lower limb BMC (ratio of geometric means [RGM]: 1.118 [95% CI: 1.112, 1.123], 1.110 [95% CI: 1.102, 1.119], 1.101 [95% CI: 1.093, 1.108], 1.146 [95% CI: 1.143, 1.155]; p &lt; 10(-10) [adjusted for sex, height, and sitting height]).

Similar results were obtained after adjusting for puberty, when truncal fat mass was used in place of total fat, and when bone area was used instead of bone mass. In analyses where total body BMC adjusted for bone area (BA) was the outcome (reflecting volumetric BMD), linear regression with fat mass showed evidence for association (1.004 [95% CI: 1.002, 1.007], p = 0.0001). IV regression also showed a positive effect (1.031 [95% CI: 1.000, 1.062], p = 0.05). When MC4R and FTO markers were used as instruments for fat mass, similar associations with BMC were seen to those with fat mass as measured by DXA. This suggests that fat mass is on the causal pathway for bone mass in children. In addition, both directly assessed and IV-assessed relationships between fat mass and volumetric density showed evidence for positive effects, supporting a hypothesis that fat effects on bone mass are not entirely accounted for by association with overall bone size.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Absorptiometry, Photon", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adipose Tissue", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Anthropometry", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Bone and Bones", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Genetic", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Organ Size", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pregnancy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Random Allocation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Spine", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "Sayers A"}, {"clean": "Davey-Smith G"}, {"clean": "Tobias J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J.

Previously, neuroimaging and cognitive studies have revealed several associations between rs1344706 and brain structure and function. The aim of this study is to use a recall-by-genotype (RBG) design to investigate the biological basis for the association of ZNF804A variants with schizophrenia. A RBG study, implemented in a population cohort, will be used to evaluate the impact of genetic variation at rs1344706 on sleep neurophysiology and procedural memory consolidation in healthy participants.', 'Participants will be recruited from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) on the basis of genotype at rs1344706 (n = 24). Each participant will be asked to take part in two nights of in-depth sleep monitoring (polysomnography) allowing collection of neurophysiological sleep data in a manner not amenable to large-scale study. Sleep questionnaires will be used to assess general sleep quality and subjective sleep experience after each in-house recording. A motor sequencing task (MST) will be performed before and after the second night of polysomnography. In order to gather additional data about habitual sleep behaviour participants will be asked to wear a wrist worn activity monitor (actiwatch) and complete a sleep diary for two weeks.', 'This study will explore the biological function of ZNF804A genotype (rs1344706) in healthy volunteers by examining detailed features of sleep architecture and physiology in relation to motor learning. Using a RBG approach will enable us to collect precise and detailed phenotypic data whilst achieving an informative biological gradient. It would not be feasible to collect such data in the large sample sizes that would be required under a random sampling scheme. By dissecting the role of individual variants associated with schizophrenia in this way, we can begin to unravel the complex genetic mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and pave the way for future development of novel therapeutic approaches.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Brain", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Healthy Volunteers", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Memory Consolidation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Motor Activity", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pilot Projects", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Polysomnography", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Schizophrenia", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sleep", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Surveys and Questionnaires", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Hellmich C"}, {"clean": "Durant C"}, {"clean": "Jones M"}, {"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "Bartsch U"}, {"clean": "Corbin L"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMC Med.

Here, we review the hypothesis that cultural modernization may in fact establish unusually intense reproductive trade-offs in wealthy relative to impoverished strata, favoring low fertility. We test this premise with British longitudinal data (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), exploring maternal self-perceptions of economic hardship in relation to increasing family size and actual socioeconomic status. Low-income and low-education-level mothers perceived the greatest economic costs associated with raising two versus one offspring.

The neighbourhood perceptions of residents were found to match the areas identified by automated zone design as well as they matched the subjectively defined communities, suggesting that the neighbourhoods identified by experts were not more real to residents than synthetic areas.

The cause of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is unknown, but there is an association with childhood febrile seizures.

To dissect out variants related to a history of febrile seizures, we tested cases with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis with (overall n = 757) and without (overall n = 803) a history of febrile seizures.

Demographic characteristics independently related to intentions to breast feed included older maternal age, more maternal education, primiparity and not smoking; in previous work all these had been associated with actual feeding behaviour. Social relationship variables had a small influence. Of the psychological variables, a notable finding was that women who were preoccupied with their body shape and those who expressed controlling, less child-centred, responses to managing an infant in the postnatal months were less likely to express intentions to breast feed.

The study population comprised 31 cohorts from the Consortium of Refractive Error and Myopia (CREAM) representing 4 different continents with 55,177 individuals; 42,845 Caucasians and 12,332 Asians. We performed a meta-analysis of 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on 15q14 and 5 SNPs on 15q25 using linear regression analysis with spherical equivalent as a quantitative outcome, adjusted for age and sex. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) of myopia versus hyperopia for carriers of the top-SNP alleles using a fixed effects meta-analysis. At locus 15q14, all SNPs were significantly replicated, with the lowest P value 3.87 \u00d7 10(-12) for SNP rs634990 in Caucasians, and 9.65 \u00d7 10(-4) for rs8032019 in Asians.

First, a panel of mouse chromosome substitution strains was used to map a genomic region on mouse chromosome 2 that contributes to voluntary wheel running levels - a behavioral readout considered a model of voluntary exercise in humans. Subsequently, we tested the syntenic region (HSA20: 51,212,545-55,212,986) in a human sample (Saint Thomas Twin Register; n=3038) and found a significant association between voluntary exercise levels (categorized into excessive and non-excessive exercise) and an intergenic SNP rs459465 (adjusted P-value of 0.001). Taking under consideration the methodological challenges embedded in this translational approach in the research of complex phenotypes, we wanted to further test the validity of this finding. Therefore, we repeated the analysis in an independent human population (ALSPAC data set; n=2557). We found a significant association of excessive exercise with two SNPs in the same genomic region (rs6022999, adjusted P-value of P=0.011 and rs6092090, adjusted P-value of 0.012). We explored the locus for possible candidate genes by means of literature search and bioinformatics analysis of gene function and of trans-regulatory elements. We propose three potential human candidate genes for voluntary physical exercise levels (MC3R, CYP24A1, and GRM8). To conclude, the identified genetic variance in the human locus 20q13.2 may affect voluntary exercise levels.

Ocular axial length (AL) is the major determinant of refraction and thus of myopia and hyperopia. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for AL, combining 12,531 Europeans and 8,216 Asians. We identified eight genome-wide significant loci for AL (RSPO1, C3orf26, LAMA2, GJD2, ZNRF3, CD55, MIP, and ALPPL2) and confirmed one previously reported AL locus (ZC3H11B). Of the nine loci, five (LAMA2, GJD2, CD55, ALPPL2, and ZC3H11B) were associated with refraction in 18 independent cohorts (n = 23,591). Differential gene expression was observed for these loci in minus-lens-induced myopia mouse experiments and human ocular tissues.

The proportion of children ever having a cough during their first 6 months of life and of those with cough symptoms, the proportion receiving cough medicine and the proportion consulting a doctor was investigated. Some 61% of children were reported as having had a cough during their first 6 months of life and this proportion did not vary significantly across educational levels. The proportion of children with coughs who were taken to a doctor (60%) and the proportion with coughs who were given cough medicine (20%), however, did vary with education. The association between mother's education level and the treatment of her child's cough was much stronger than with either of the mother's age or number of other children. After controlling for confounding factors, the percentage of mothers who consulted a doctor for their children's coughs decreased progressively with increasing maternal education from 70% (95% confidence interval: 66%, 73%) of those with CSE or less to 50% (95% CI: 45%, 55%) of those with a degree.

The results show that the scale derived from responses to the AMT operates well over a wide range of scores, consistent with the aim of deriving a continuous measure of over-general memory. There was strong evidence of group differences in terms of gender, low negative mood, and IQ, and these were in agreement when comparing an item response theory (IRT) approach with that based on a sum score. One advantage of the IRT model is the ability to assess and consequently allow for differential item functioning.

At all ages, higher scores on a Discretionary pattern (characterized by biscuits, chocolate, sweets, soda, crisps) were associated with 1-2 point lower IQ. A Breastfeeding pattern at 6 months and Home-made contemporary patterns at 15 and 24 months (herbs, legumes, cheese, raw fruit and vegetables) were associated with 1-to-2 point higher IQ. A Home-made traditional pattern (meat, cooked vegetables, desserts) at 6 months was positively associated with higher IQ scores, but there was no association with similar patterns at 15 or 24 months. Negative associations were found with patterns characterized by Ready-prepared baby foods at 6 and 15 months and positive associations with a Ready-to-eat foods pattern at 24 months. Propensity score analyses were consistent with regression analyses. This study suggests that dietary patterns from 6 to 24 months may have a small but persistent effect on IQ at 8 years.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Breast Feeding", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Diet", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Feeding Behavior", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Follow-Up Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Intelligence", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Intelligence Tests", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Principal Component Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Surveys and Questionnaires", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Smithers L"}, {"clean": "Golley R"}, {"clean": "Mittinty M"}, {"clean": "Brazionis L"}, {"clean": "Northstone K"}, {"clean": "Emmett P"}, {"clean": "Lynch J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Eur.

The degree of confounding can sometimes be estimated by comparing the association between exposures experienced by the mother during pregnancy and outcomes among the offspring with the association of exposures experienced by the father during the pregnancy period and offspring outcomes. If the effects are due to an intrauterine exposure, then maternal exposure during pregnancy should have a clearly greater influence than paternal exposure. A different approach is that of Mendelian randomization, which utilizes genetic variants of known functional effect that can proxy for modifiable exposures. If carried by the mother, these variants would influence the intrauterine environment experienced by her offspring. These genetic variants are stable over time and can be assessed after pregnancy is complete or even after outcomes in the offspring have been observed.

Linear mixed effects models (LMM) are commonly used to model longitudinal data; however, it is unclear if the failure to meet the models distributional assumptions will affect the conclusions when conducting a genome-wide association study. In an extensive simulation study, we compare coverage probabilities, bias, type 1 error rates and statistical power when the error of the LMM is either heteroscedastic or has a non-Gaussian distribution. We conclude that the model is robust to misspecification if the same function of age is included in the fixed and random effects. However, type 1 error of the genetic effect over time is inflated, regardless of the model misspecification, if the polynomial function for age in the fixed and random effects differs. In situations where the model will not converge with a high order polynomial function in the random effects, a reduced function can be used but a robust standard error needs to be calculated to avoid inflation of the type 1 error. As an illustration, a LMM was applied to longitudinal body mass index (BMI) data over childhood in the ALSPAC cohort; the results emphasised the need for the robust standard error to ensure correct inference of associations of longitudinal BMI with chromosome 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Body Mass Index", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Theoretical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Probability", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Warrington N"}, {"clean": "Tilling K"}, {"clean": "Howe L"}, {"clean": "Paternoster L"}, {"clean": "Pennell C"}, {"clean": "Wu Y"}, {"clean": "Briollais L"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol", "volume": "13", "issue": "5"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "GAILLFN9", "DOI": "10.1111/add.12268", "DOI_filename": "6e29db70a8489e4d8499ee2e388fee81", "PMID": "23734913", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84887614756", "hash": "2599eb6780ada9c2b44edc78781ae6e8"}, "clean": {"title": "Childhood conduct disorder trajectories, prior risk factors and cannabis use at age 16: birth cohort study.", "abstract": "['To investigate the prevalence of cannabis use and problem use in boys and girls at age 16 years, and to investigate the role of adversity in early life and of conduct disorder between the ages of 4 and 13 years as risk factors for these outcomes.', 'Birth cohort study.', 'England.', 'A total of 4159 (2393 girls) participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort providing information on cannabis use at age 16.', 'Cannabis use and problem cannabis use at age 16 were assessed by postal questionnaire.

ALSPAC Survey Team.

It has been proposed that social support constitutes a causal link between health and deprivation such that those with lower socio-economic status have poorer health because their lack of social support makes them more vulnerable to disease. This assumption was tested in this study for women moving from pregnancy to early motherhood. The sample of 9208 women was drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). Health status was measured by self-report of morbidity for three contrasting conditions: backache, depression and urinary infection. Data were collected by self-completion questionnaire at eight weeks prepartum and at eight weeks postpartum. The sample was divided into four groups for each condition on the basis of identification of the condition (1) on both occasions, (2) on neither occasion, (3) at eight weeks prepartum only, and (4) at eight weeks postpartum only. Chi-square tests were used to measure the association between presence or absence of a condition as defined above, material deprivation and low social support. Responses on an eight item social support questionnaire tapping emotional, instrumental and communal aspects of perceived social support were compared between these groups for each condition. Results showed significant associations, in late pregnancy and early motherhood, between poorer health and both material deprivation and low social support for two of the three conditions, depression and urinary infection. Changes in levels of perceived social support occurred as a consequence of motherhood; the percentage of women perceiving their partner to be supportive decreased as did the percentage of those who felt that their family or friends would help with financial difficulties; in contrast, the percentage of those perceiving that other mothers/neighbours offered support increased from late pregnancy to early motherhood. The extent and direction of such change was consistently associated with the presence or absence of depression, but not with backache or urinary infection. When mental health \"improved\", in that depression was present pre- but not postpartum, the percentage feeling supported increased and vice versa. This pattern was in evidence across all items of social support. It was concluded that perceived social support was unlikely in itself to constitute a causal link between poorer health and lower socio-economic status. In this context the relationship between social support and depression requires further consideration, particularly the extent to which they constitute component parts of a more general feeling of emotional well-being, a construct which is, in its turn, in need of further articulation in relation to health outcomes.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Causality", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Depressive Disorder", "major": "N"}, {"term": "England", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Status Indicators", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant, Newborn", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mothers", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Poverty", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pregnancy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pregnancy Complications", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Puerperal Disorders", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Social Support", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Baker D"}, {"clean": "Taylor H"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Soc Sci Med", "volume": "45", "issue": "9"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "GMRIAXCK", "DOI": "10.1016/j.schres.2010.10.021", "DOI_filename": "8c92d53d2d7b28962c29d21bb8373f9f", "PMID": "21146371", "scopus": "2-s2.0-79952009520", "hash": "2b06a11d0abb0179ee115ad2f6d449cd"}, "clean": {"title": "Examining the association between maternal analgesic use during pregnancy and risk of psychotic symptoms during adolescence.", "abstract": "[\"Children and adolescents who report psychotic symptoms in non-clinical samples are at an increased risk of developing schizophrenia.

This finding has implications for understanding of how liability to bipolar disorder may have been selected through generations. It will also inform future genetic studies at the interface of intelligence, creativity and bipolar disorder and is relevant to the developmental trajectory of bipolar disorder. It may also improve approaches to earlier detection and treatment of bipolar disorder in adolescents and young adults.', 'None.', '\u00a9 The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2015.

New diagnostic categories rely on the distinct clinical utility of irritability, and models of psychopathology suggest it plays a key role in explaining developmental pathways within and between disorders into adulthood. However, only a few studies have tested multidimensional models of ODD, and the results have been conflicting. Further, consensus has not been reached regarding which symptoms best identify irritability. The present analyses use 5 large community data sets with 5 different measures of parent-reported ODD, comprising 16,280 youth in total, to help resolve these questions. Across the samples, ages ranged from 5 to 18, and included both boys and girls. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that a modified bifactor model showed the best fit in each data set. The structure of the model included 2 correlated specific factors (irritability and oppositional behavior) in addition to a general ODD factor. In 4 models, the best fit was obtained using the items \"being touchy,\" \"angry,\" and \"often losing temper\" as indicators of irritability. Given the structure of the models and the generally high correlation between the specific dimensions, the results suggest that irritability may not be sufficiently distinct from oppositional behavior to support an entirely independent diagnosis. Rather, irritability may be better understood as a dimension of psychopathology that can be distinguished within ODD, and which may be related to particular forms of psychopathology apart from ODD.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Irritable Mood", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Burke J"}, {"clean": "Boylan K"}, {"clean": "Rowe R"}, {"clean": "Duku E"}, {"clean": "Stepp S"}, {"clean": "Hipwell A"}, {"clean": "Waldman I"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Abnorm Psychol", "volume": "123", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "HE9HSEGI", "DOI": "10.1542/peds.2011-1556", "DOI_filename": "2360e607f9a105d98e00145f430efb7f", "PMID": "22451706", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84859412458", "hash": "9ef44304561256c6081667cd9e2433f2"}, "clean": {"title": "Mental health difficulties in children with developmental coordination disorder.", "abstract": "['To explore the associations between probable developmental coordination disorder (DCD) defined at age 7 years and mental health difficulties at age 9 to 10 years.', 'We analyzed of prospectively collected data (N = 6902) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. \"Probable\" DCD was defined by using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria as those children below the 15th centile of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Coordination Test, with functional limitations in activities of daily living or handwriting, excluding children with neurologic difficulties or an IQ &lt;70.

The association between LRP5 gene polymorphisms and bone size and mineralization was examined in 819 unrelated British Caucasian children (n = 429 boys) aged 9 years. Height, weight, pubertal status (where available), total-body and spinal bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), BMD, and area-adjusted BMC (aBMC) were assessed. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-gene associations were assessed by linear regression, with adjustment for age, gender, pubertal status, and body size parameters. There were 140, 79, 12, and 2 girls who achieved Tanner stages I-IV, respectively, and 179 and 32 boys who achieved Tanner stages I and II, respectively. The rs2,306,862 (N740N) coding polymorphism in exon 10 of the LRP5 gene was associated with spinal BMD and aBMC (each P = 0.01) and total-body BMD and aBMC (P = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). Adjusting for pubertal stage strengthened associations between this polymorphism and spinal BMD and aBMC (P = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Individuals homozygous for the T allele had greater spinal BMD and aBMC scores than those homozygous for the C allele. A dose effect was apparent as the mean spinal BMD and aBMC of heterozygous TC individuals were intermediate between those of their TT and CC counterparts. The N740N polymorphism in exon 10 of LRP5 was associated with spinal BMD and aBMC in pre- and early pubertal children. These results indicate that LRP5 influences volumetric bone density in childhood, possibly through effects on trabecular bone formation.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Age Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Body Weight", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Bone Density", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Haplotypes", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "LDL-Receptor Related Proteins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-5", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Genetic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Phenotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Genetic", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Koay M"}, {"clean": "Tobias J"}, {"clean": "Leary S"}, {"clean": "Steer C"}, {"clean": "Vilari\u00f1o-G\u00fcell C"}, {"clean": "Brown M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Calcif.

Six of the 15 alleles that were inversely related to BMD were positively related to CTX (p&lt;0.05 cut-off) (n=2379). Subsequently, we performed a meta-analysis of associations between these SNPs and PC in ALSPAC (n=3382), Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants (GOOD) (n=938), and the Young Finns Study (YFS) (n=1558). Five of the 15 alleles that were inversely related to BMD were positively related to PC (p&lt;0.05 cut-off). We conclude that despite having lower BMD, individuals with a genetic predisposition to higher bone resorption have greater bone size, suggesting that higher bone resorption is permissive for greater periosteal expansion.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Bone Resorption", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Collagen Type I", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cross-Sectional Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Markers", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Periosteum", "major": "N"}, {"term": "RANK Ligand", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Kemp J"}, {"clean": "Sayers A"}, {"clean": "Paternoster L"}, {"clean": "Evans D"}, {"clean": "Deere K"}, {"clean": "St Pourcain B"}, {"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "Ring S"}, {"clean": "Lorentzon M"}, {"clean": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T"}, {"clean": "Eriksson J"}, {"clean": "K\u00e4h\u00f6nen M"}, {"clean": "Raitakari O"}, {"clean": "Laaksonen M"}, {"clean": "Siev\u00e4nen H"}, {"clean": "Viikari J"}, {"clean": "Lyytik\u00e4inen L"}, {"clean": "Smith G"}, {"clean": "Fraser W"}, {"clean": "Vandenput L"}, {"clean": "Ohlsson C"}, {"clean": "Tobias J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J.

We describe how regression coefficients can be calculated for these associations and how these can be adjusted for other parameters such as random effect variables relating to baseline values or rates of change in earlier time periods, and compare different methods for calculating the standard errors of these regression coefficients. We also show that these models can equivalently be fitted in the structural equation modelling framework and apply each method to weight and mean arterial pressure changes during pregnancy, obtaining similar results for multilevel and structural equation models. This method improves on the multivariate linear growth models, which have been used previously to model parallel processes because it enables nonlinear patterns of change to be modelled and the temporal sequence of multivariate changes to be determined, with adjustment for change in earlier time periods.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Biometry", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Blood Pressure", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Databases, Factual", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Growth", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant, Newborn", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Linear Models", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Biological", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Multivariate Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pregnancy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Weight Gain", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Macdonald-Wallis C"}, {"clean": "Lawlor D"}, {"clean": "Palmer T"}, {"clean": "Tilling K"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Stat Med", "volume": "31", "issue": "26"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "J4MPQMNM", "DOI": "10.1002/ab.20357", "DOI_filename": "b93026fdb1b737b2ecf31ea835bfd36e", "PMID": "20648575", "scopus": "2-s2.0-77956289666", "hash": "d6478624937ee4b60dbe74ac3e47977b"}, "clean": {"title": "Concurrent and prospective associations between facial affect recognition accuracy and childhood antisocial behavior.", "abstract": "[\"This study examined the concurrent and prospective associations between children's ability to accurately recognize facial affect at age 8.5 and antisocial behavior at age 8.5 and 10.5 years in a sub sample of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (5,396 children; 2,644, 49% males).

randomisation is a form of instrumental variable analysis that estimates the causal effect of an intermediate phenotype or exposure on an outcome or disease in the presence of unobserved confounding,

A Bayesian approach allows current knowledge to be incorporated into the analysis in the form of informative prior distributions, and the unobserved confounder can be modelled explicitly. We consider Bayesian methods for Mendelian randomisation in the case where all relationships are linear and there are no interactions. A 'full' model in which the unobserved confounder is included explicitly is not completely identifiable, although the causal parameter can be estimated. We compare inferences from this general but non-identified model with a reduced parameter model that is identifiable. We show that, theoretically, additional information about the causal parameter can be obtained by using the non-identifiable full model, rather than the identifiable reduced model, but that this is advantageous only when realistically informative priors are used and when the instrument is weak or the sample size is small.

GWAS was performed in a total of 1862 participants using the first principal component computed from several quantitative measures of reading- and language-related abilities, both before and after adjustment for performance IQ.

We investigated these findings in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a large European birth cohort of mothers and offspring, and by generating a predicted model of the structure of this domain.

In general, sites that were hypermethylated in association with maternal obesity or hypomethylated in association with maternal underweight tended to be positively associated with offspring adiposity, and sites hypomethylated in association with maternal obesity or hypermethylated in association with maternal underweight tended to be inversely associated with offspring adiposity.', 'Our data suggest that both maternal obesity and, to a larger degree, underweight affect the neonatal epigenome via an intrauterine mechanism, but weight gain during pregnancy has little effect.

We found a positive association between additional minor (A) alleles and BMI from 5.5 years onwards, but an inverse association below age 2.5 years. Modelling median BMI curves for each genotype using the LMS method, we found that carriers of minor alleles showed lower BMI in infancy, earlier adiposity rebound (AR), and higher BMI later in childhood. Differences by allele were consistent with two independent processes: earlier AR equivalent to accelerating developmental age by 2.37% (95% CI 1.87, 2.87, p\\u200a=\\u200a10(-20)) per A allele and a positive age by genotype interaction such that BMI increased faster with age (p\\u200a=\\u200a10(-23)).

Genetic variants typically explain a small proportion of the variability in risk factors; hence Mendelian randomisation analyses can require large sample sizes. However, an increasing number of genetic variants have been found to be robustly associated with disease-related outcomes in genome-wide association studies. Use of multiple instruments can improve the precision of IV estimates, and also permit examination of underlying IV assumptions. We discuss the use of multiple genetic variants in Mendelian randomisation analyses with continuous outcome variables where all relationships are assumed to be linear. We describe possible violations of IV assumptions, and how multiple instrument analyses can be used to identify them. We present an example using four adiposity-associated genetic variants as IVs for the causal effect of fat mass on bone density, using data on 5509 children enrolled in the ALSPAC birth cohort study. We also use simulation studies to examine the effect of different sets of IVs on precision and bias. When each instrument independently explains variability in the risk factor, use of multiple instruments increases the precision of IV estimates. However, inclusion of weak instruments could increase finite sample bias. Missing data on multiple genetic variants can diminish the available sample size, compared with single instrument analyses.

Further, while many identified pubertal timing variants associate with age at menarche, a late manifestation of puberty, and body mass, little is known about these variants' relationship to pubertal initiation or tempo. To address these questions, we performed genome-wide association meta-analysis in over 11 000 European samples with data on early pubertal traits, male genital and female breast development, measured by the Tanner scale. We report the first genome-wide significant locus for male sexual development upstream of myocardin-like 2 (MKL2) (P = 8.9 \u00d7 10(-9)), a menarche locus tagging a developmental pathway linking earlier puberty with reduced pubertal growth (P = 4.6 \u00d7 10(-5)) and short adult stature (p = 7.5 \u00d7 10(-6)) in both males and females. Furthermore, our results indicate that a proportion of menarche loci are important for pubertal initiation in both sexes. Consistent with epidemiological correlations between increased prepubertal body mass and earlier pubertal timing in girls, body mass index (BMI)-increasing alleles correlated with earlier breast development. In boys, some BMI-increasing alleles associated with earlier, and others with delayed, sexual development; these genetic results mimic the controversy in epidemiological studies, some of which show opposing correlations between prepubertal BMI and male puberty. Our results contribute to our understanding of the pubertal initiation program in both sexes and indicate that although mechanisms regulating pubertal onset in males and females may largely be shared, the relationship between body mass and pubertal timing in boys may be complex and requires further genetic studies. \"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adiposity", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Body Mass Index", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Breast", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16", "major": "N"}, {"term": "European Continental Ancestry Group", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Loci", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genitalia, Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Menarche", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Puberty", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sex Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sexual Maturation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Transcription Factors", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Cousminer D"}, {"clean": "Stergiakouli E"}, {"clean": "Berry D"}, {"clean": "Ang W"}, {"clean": "Groen-Blokhuis M"}, {"clean": "K\u00f6rner A"}, {"clean": "Siitonen N"}, {"clean": "Ntalla I"}, {"clean": "Marinelli M"}, {"clean": "Perry J"}, {"clean": "Kettunen J"}, {"clean": "Jansen R"}, {"clean": "Surakka I"}, {"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "Ring S"}, {"clean": "Mcmahon G"}, {"clean": "Power C"}, {"clean": "Wang C"}, {"clean": "K\u00e4h\u00f6nen M"}, {"clean": "Viikari J"}, {"clean": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T"}, {"clean": "Middeldorp C"}, {"clean": "Hulshoff Pol H"}, {"clean": "Neef M"}, {"clean": "Weise S"}, {"clean": "Pahkala K"}, {"clean": "Niinikoski H"}, {"clean": "Zeggini E"}, {"clean": "Panoutsopoulou K"}, {"clean": "Bustamante M"}, {"clean": "Penninx B"}, {"clean": "Murabito J"}, {"clean": "Torrent M"}, {"clean": "Dedoussis G"}, {"clean": "Kiess W"}, {"clean": "Boomsma D"}, {"clean": "Pennell C"}, {"clean": "Raitakari O"}, {"clean": "Hypp\u00f6nen E"}, {"clean": "Davey Smith G"}, {"clean": "Ripatti S"}, {"clean": "McCarthy M"}, {"clean": "Wid\u00e9n E"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Hum.

One possible explanation is that the association between COMT and PEs is indirect, through cognitive function and anxiety disorders. We examined whether the association between PEs and COMT (four single nucleotide polymorphisms and three haplotypes) is indirect, through cognition or anxiety disorders. 6,784 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were genotyped and completed neurocognitive assessments at ages 8 and 11, as well as semi-structured interviews for anxiety disorders and PEs at ages 10 and 12, respectively.

However, the frequency among healthy children in the community is not well characterized, which, if known, could inform better interpretation of the pathogenic burden of this mutational category in children with developmental disorders. In a case-control analysis, we compared the rate of large-scale mosaicism between 1303 children with developmental disorders and 5094 children lacking developmental disorders, using an analytical pipeline we developed, and identified a substantial enrichment in cases (odds ratio = 39.4, P-value 1.073e - 6). A meta-analysis that included frequency estimates among an additional 7000 children with congenital diseases yielded an even stronger statistical enrichment (P-value 1.784e - 11). In addition, to maximize the detection of low-clonality events in probands, we applied a trio-based mosaic detection algorithm, which detected two additional events in probands, including an individual with genome-wide suspected chimerism. In total, we detected 12 structural mosaic abnormalities among 1303 children (0.9%). Given the burden of mosaicism detected in cases, we suspected that many of the events detected in probands were pathogenic.

At each age, an estimate of the variance in refractive error explained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants was calculated using genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) using high-density genome-wide SNP genotype information (minimum N at each age=3,404).', 'The variance in refractive error explained by the SNPs (\"SNP heritability\") was stable over childhood: Across age 7-15 years, SNP heritability averaged 0.28 (SE=0.08, p&lt;0.001). The genetic correlation for refractive error between visits varied from 0.77 to 1.00 (all p&lt;0.001) demonstrating that a common set of SNPs was responsible for the genetic contribution to refractive error across this period of childhood. Simulations suggested lack of cycloplegia during autorefraction led to a small underestimation of SNP heritability (adjusted SNP heritability=0.35; SE=0.09). To put these results in context, the variance in refractive error explained (or predicted) by the time participants spent outdoors was &lt;0.005 and by the time spent reading was &lt;0.01, based on a parental questionnaire completed when the child was aged 8-9 years old.', 'Genetic variation captured by common SNPs explained approximately 35% of the variation in refractive error between unrelated subjects. This value sets an upper limit for predicting refractive error using existing SNP genotyping arrays, although higher-density genotyping in larger samples and inclusion of interaction effects is expected to raise this figure toward twin- and family-based heritability estimates. The same SNPs influenced refractive error across much of childhood. Notwithstanding the strong evidence of association between time outdoors and myopia, and time reading and myopia, less than 1% of the variance in myopia at age 15 was explained by crude measures of these two risk factors, indicating that their effects may be limited, at least when averaged over the whole population.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "England", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Leisure Activities", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Myopia", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Quantitative Trait, Heritable", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Reading", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Refractive Errors", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Guggenheim J"}, {"clean": "St Pourcain B"}, {"clean": "McMahon G"}, {"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "Evans D"}, {"clean": "Williams C"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Mol.

Adolescence is a normal developmental transition associated with clearly visible physical changes, reorganization and pruning of neuronal circuits in the brain and the occurrence of new behaviours and interests. It is a time when new life tasks (orientation towards peers of the other sex, romantic and sexual involvement and mastering an educational career) need to be mastered. Parent-child conflict increases and becomes more intense as the adolescent struggles for more independence while still requiring support. These normal changes can become problematic if biological and social expectations diverge e.g. entering puberty very early or very late.

We then explored if the variation of the level of expression of the cis genes were causally affecting the level of expression of the trans genes and discovered several causal relationships between variation in the level of expression of the cis gene and variation of the level of expression of the trans gene. This analysis shows that a large sample size allows the discovery of secondary effects of human variations on gene expression that can be used to construct short directed gene regulatory networks.

However, false positive (FP) connections arise frequently and influence the inferred topology of networks. Thresholding is often used to overcome this problem, but an appropriate threshold often relies on a priori assumptions, which will alter inferred network topologies. Four common network metrics (global efficiency, mean clustering coefficient, mean betweenness and smallworldness) were tested using a model tractography dataset. It was found that all four network metrics were significantly affected even by just one FP. Results also show that thresholding effectively dampens the impact of FPs, but at the expense of adding significant bias to network metrics. In a larger number (n=248) of tractography datasets, statistics were computed across random group permutations for a range of thresholds, revealing that statistics for network metrics varied significantly more than for non-network metrics (i.e., number of streamlines and number of edges). Varying degrees of network atrophy were introduced artificially to half the datasets, to test sensitivity to genuine group differences. For some network metrics, this atrophy was detected as significant (p&lt;0.05, determined using permutation testing) only across a limited range of thresholds. We propose a multi-threshold permutation correction (MTPC) method, based on the cluster-enhanced permutation correction approach, to identify sustained significant effects across clusters of thresholds. This approach minimises requirements to determine a single threshold a priori. We demonstrate improved sensitivity of MTPC-corrected metrics to genuine group effects compared to an existing approach and demonstrate the use of MTPC on a previously published network analysis of tractography data derived from a clinical population. In conclusion, we show that there are large biases and instability induced by thresholding, making statistical comparisons of network metrics difficult. However, by testing for effects across multiple thresholds using MTPC, true group differences can be robustly identified.

We studied repeat antenatal blood pressure measurements of 9697 women in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (median [interquartile range], 10 [9-11] measurements per woman). Bivariate linear spline models were used to relate blood pressure changes to perinatal outcomes. Higher systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure at baseline (8 weeks of gestation) and a greater increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between 18 and 36 weeks of gestation were associated with lower offspring birth weight and being smaller for gestational age in confounder-adjusted models. For example, the mean difference (95% confidence interval) in birth weight per 1 mm Hg/wk greater increase in systolic blood pressure between 18 and 30 weeks was -71 g (-134 to -14) and between 30 and 36 weeks was -175 g (-208 to -145). A smaller decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure before 18 weeks and a greater increase between 18 and 36 weeks were associated with a shorter gestation (percentage difference in gestational duration per 1 mm Hg/wk greater increase in systolic blood pressure between 18 and 30 weeks was -0.60% [-1.01 to -0.18] and between 30 and 36 weeks was -1.01% [-1.36 to -0.74]).

The aim of this study was to utilise a large, prospective population cohort to examine the relationship between depression symptom trajectories in mothers over the first eleven years of their child's life and subsequent adolescent suicidal ideation. An additional aim was to test if associations were explained by maternal suicide attempt and offspring depressive disorder. Data were utilised from a population-based birth cohort: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Maternal depression symptoms were assessed repeatedly from pregnancy to child age 11 years. Offspring suicidal ideation was assessed at age 16 years. Using multiple imputation, data for 10,559 families were analysed. Using latent class growth analysis, five distinct classes of maternal depression symptoms were identified (minimal, mild, increasing, sub-threshold, chronic-severe). The prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation at age 16 years was 15% (95% CI: 14-17%). Compared to offspring of mothers with minimal symptoms, the greatest risk of suicidal ideation was found for offspring of mothers with chronic-severe symptoms [OR 3.04 (95% CI 2.19, 4.21)], with evidence for smaller increases in risk of suicidal ideation in offspring of mothers with sub-threshold, increasing and mild symptoms. These associations were not fully accounted for by maternal suicide attempt or offspring depression diagnosis.

Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that timing of puberty is most closely linked to infancy weight gain: suggesting an early window for programming of growth and development. Earlier puberty in the UK MRC 1946 birth cohort was related to smaller size at birth and rapid growth between 0 and 2 years. Rapid early weight gain leads to taller childhood stature and higher insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels, possibly through early induction of growth hormone (GH) receptor numbers, and such children are also at risk of childhood obesity. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, rapid infancy weight gain was associated with increased risk of obesity at 5 and 8 years, with evidence of insulin resistance, exaggerated adrenarche and reduced levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Potentially the elevated IGF-I and adrenal androgen levels, increased aromatase activity and increased 'free' sex steroid levels consequent to lower SHBG levels could all promote activity of the GnRH pulse generator. In addition obese children have higher leptin levels, a proven permissive factor in initiating LH pulsatility. Obesity could also affect the rate of progression through puberty as nutrition and SHBG may act respectively as an accelerator and brake on peripheral sex steroid action. Early weight gain and early pubertal development might also be associated with loss of the pubertal growth spurt perhaps through obesity-related suppression of GH secretion. Trans-generational recurrence of low birth weight, early catch-up weight gain, earlier menarche, and shorter adult stature have been observed in women, and could contribute to the strong heritability in age at menarche.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Age Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Biological Clocks", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Body Height", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Epigenesis, Genetic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Growth and Development", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant, Newborn", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Insulin Resistance", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Menarche", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Puberty", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Weight Gain", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Dunger D"}, {"clean": "Ahmed M"}, {"clean": "Ong K"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Mol.

Tympanometry was carried out at ages 8, 12, 18, 25, 31, 37 and 43 months of age. Bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME) was identified if both ears showed a flat trace.

When relevant genes are identified it is often possible to implicate biological intermediates and pathways likely to be involved in disease aetiology. However, single genetic variants typically explain small amounts of disease risk. Our idea is to construct allelic scores that explain greater proportions of the variance in biological intermediates, and subsequently use these scores to data mine GWAS. To investigate the approach's properties, we indexed three biological intermediates where the results of large GWAS meta-analyses were available: body mass index, C-reactive protein and low density lipoprotein levels. We generated allelic scores in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, and in publicly available data from the first Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We compared the explanatory ability of allelic scores in terms of their capacity to proxy for the intermediate of interest, and the extent to which they associated with disease. We found that allelic scores derived from known variants and allelic scores derived from hundreds of thousands of genetic markers explained significant portions of the variance in biological intermediates of interest, and many of these scores showed expected correlations with disease. Genome-wide allelic scores however tended to lack specificity suggesting that they should be used with caution and perhaps only to proxy biological intermediates for which there are no known individual variants. Power calculations confirm the feasibility of extending our strategy to the analysis of tens of thousands of molecular phenotypes in large genome-wide meta-analyses. We conclude that our method represents a simple way in which potentially tens of thousands of molecular phenotypes could be screened for causal relationships with disease without having to expensively measure these variables in individual disease collections. \"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Alleles", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "C-Reactive Protein", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome, Human", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Phenotype", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Evans D"}, {"clean": "Brion M"}, {"clean": "Paternoster L"}, {"clean": "Kemp J"}, {"clean": "McMahon G"}, {"clean": "Munaf\u00f2 M"}, {"clean": "Whitfield J"}, {"clean": "Medland S"}, {"clean": "Montgomery G"}, {"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "St Pourcain B"}, {"clean": "Lawlor D"}, {"clean": "Martin N"}, {"clean": "Dehghan A"}, {"clean": "Hirschhorn J"}, {"clean": "Smith G"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS Genet.", "volume": "9", "issue": "10"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "R7DRUB6W", "DOI": "10.1186/1471-2458-11-485", "DOI_filename": "61ada4cc85d0b814801311a3b5233b1e", "PMID": "21693008", "scopus": "2-s2.0-79959240750", "hash": "e7a5ab67ad0003b7335ddf5ab7fed846"}, "clean": {"title": "International children's accelerometry database (ICAD): design and methods.", "abstract": "[\"Over the past decade, accelerometers have increased in popularity as an objective measure of physical activity in free-living individuals.

The authors show that the multiplicative structural mean model (MSMM) and the multiplicative generalized method of moments (MGMM) estimator produce identical estimates of the causal risk ratio. In the example, MSMM and MGMM estimates suggested an inverse relation between BMI and asthma but other IV estimates suggested a positive relation, although all estimates had wide confidence intervals. An interaction between the associations of BMI and fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype with asthma explained the different directions of the different estimates, and a simulation study supported the observation that MSMM/MGMM estimators are negatively correlated with the other estimators when such an interaction is present. The authors conclude that point estimates from various IV methods can differ in practical applications.

As an example, multiple-source reports are commonly collected in child and adolescent psychiatric epidemiologic studies where researchers use various informants (e.g. parent and adolescent) to provide a holistic view of a subject's symptomatology. Fitzmaurice et al. (1995) have described estimation of multiple source models using a standard generalized estimating equation (GEE) framework. However, these studies often have missing data due to additional stages of consent and assent required. The usual GEE is unbiased when missingness is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) in the sense of Little and Rubin (2002). This is a strong assumption that may not be tenable. Other options such as weighted generalized estimating equations (WEEs) are computationally challenging when missingness is non-monotone. Multiple imputation is an attractive method to fit incomplete data models while only requiring the less restrictive Missing at Random (MAR) assumption. Previously estimation of partially observed clustered data was computationally challenging however recent developments in Stata have facilitated their use in practice. We demonstrate how to utilize multiple imputation in conjunction with a GEE to investigate the prevalence of disordered eating symptoms in adolescents reported by parents and adolescents as well as factors associated with concordance and prevalence.

An air quality standard has been established for ambient air in the UK to reduce the population's exposure. It has been estimated that about 70% of benzene emissions to air in the UK come from petrol vehicles. A number of studies, including the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood in the UK, have found that benzene concentrations in homes with attached or integral garages tend to be higher than in those without such garages. The present paper reviews these studies and reports a detailed investigation of five homes with either an attached or an integral garage. Indoor and outdoor locations were monitored using diffusive sampling to determine the average benzene concentration over approximately 28 days each month for 18 consecutive months (June 1998-November 1999). For one of these homes, ten years of data had shown the indoor benzene concentration to be consistently higher than outdoors. Personal exposure monitoring of one adult in this home showed that the benzene concentration in the main bedroom was a better predictor of personal exposure than the concentration outdoors. In the homes where a car was regularly parked in the garage, 18-month average benzene concentrations of up to 101.3 micrograms m-3 were measured in the garage, which is more than six times the ambient air quality standard for benzene (16.25 micrograms m-3 running annual average). Mean benzene values in all cars and most of the garages studied exceeded the benzene standard. Mean benzene concentrations in the room above the garage ranged from 3.7 micrograms m-3 in one home, where the car was rarely parked in the garage, to 39.9 micrograms m-3 in another home where a car with high benzene emissions was parked in the garage for six of the 18 months monitored. The mean benzene concentration in the room above the garage in this latter home was nearly 2.5 times the ambient air standard. The study demonstrates that there is a potential for people to have a higher exposure to benzene as a result of living in a home with an attached or integral garage. An understanding of routes of personal exposure is important to develop effective policies to reduce risks to health.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Air Pollution, Indoor", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Benzene", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Environmental Monitoring", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Housing", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Seasons", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Time Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Vehicle Emissions", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Mann H"}, {"clean": "Crump D"}, {"clean": "Brown V"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J R Soc Promot Health", "volume": "121", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "RX3YBM33", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.12.013", "DOI_filename": "aba323129290c1eb7f205719f3807a06", "PMID": "25601656", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84933280438", "hash": "ef074698059de2db91374993e14aaa23"}, "clean": {"title": "Physical activity in school-age children born preterm.", "abstract": "['To compare objectively measured physical activity in 11- and 15-year-old children who were born preterm with term-born controls and related physical activity measures to lung function measures.', \"We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

Findings Although higher socio-economic position was strongly associated with breastfeeding in ALSPAC, there was little such patterning in Pelotas. In ALSPAC, breastfeeding was associated with lower BP, lower BMI and higher IQ, adjusted for confounders, but in the directions expected if due to socioeconomic patterning. In contrast, in Pelotas, breastfeeding was not strongly associated with BP or BMI but was associated with higher IQ.

It is pertinent to understand the degree to which the offspring methylome is sensitive to the intensity and duration of prenatal smoking. An investigation of the persistence of offspring methylation associated with maternal smoking and the relative roles of the intrauterine and postnatal environment is also warranted. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we investigated associations between prenatal exposure to maternal smoking and offspring DNA methylation at multiple time points in approximately 800 mother-offspring pairs. In cord blood, methylation at 15 CpG sites in seven gene regions (AHRR, MYO1G, GFI1, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, KLF13 and ATP9A) was associated with maternal smoking, and a dose-dependent response was observed in relation to smoking duration and intensity. Longitudinal analysis of blood DNA methylation in serial samples at birth, age 7 and 17 years demonstrated that some CpG sites showed reversibility of methylation (GFI1, KLF13 and ATP9A), whereas others showed persistently perturbed patterns (AHRR, MYO1G, CYP1A1 and CNTNAP2). Of those showing persistence, we explored the effect of postnatal smoke exposure and found that the major contribution to altered methylation was attributed to a critical window of in utero exposure. A comparison of paternal and maternal smoking and offspring methylation showed consistently stronger maternal associations, providing further evidence for causal intrauterine mechanisms. These findings emphasize the sensitivity of the methylome to maternal smoking during early development and the long-term impact of such exposure.

The association between sociability and alcohol problems was mediated through increased extraversion and sensation-seeking for both genders. Boys also showed mediation for sociability and alcohol outcomes through friendship characteristics, and girls through lower conscientiousness and reduced emotional stability.', 'Our findings support multiple pathways to alcohol consumption and problems in adolescence.

Out of 14,256 children participating in the study, 293 were investigated by social services for suspected maltreatment and 115 were placed on local child protection registers prior to their 6th birthday. Data on the children have been obtained from obstetric data and from a series of parental questionnaires administered during pregnancy and the first 3 years of life. Risk factors have been analyzed using an hierarchical approach to logistic regression analysis.', 'In the stepwise hierarchical analysis, young parents, those with low educational achievement, and those with a past psychiatric history or a history of childhood abuse were all more likely to be investigated for maltreatment, or to have a child placed on the child protection register, with odds ratios between 1.86 and 4.96 for registration. Examining strength of effect, the highest risks were found with indicators of deprivation (3.24 for investigation and 11.02 for registration, after adjusting for parental background factors). Poor social networks increased the risk of both investigation (adjusted OR 1.93) and registration (adjusted OR 1.90). Maternal employment seemed to reduce the risk of both outcomes but adjusted odds ratios were no longer significant for registration. After adjusting for higher order confounders, single parents and reordered families were both at higher risk of registration. Reported domestic violence increased the risk of investigation and registration but this was no longer significant after adjusting for higher order variables. Low birthweight children were at higher risk of registration as were those whose parents reported few positive attributes of their babies.', \"This study supports previous research in the field demonstrating that a wide range of factors in the parental background, socio-economic and family environments affect the risk of child maltreatment. By combining factors within a comprehensive ecological framework, we have demonstrated that the strongest risks are from socio-economic deprivation and from factors in the parents' own background and that parental background factors are largely, but not entirely, mediated through their impact on socio-economic factors.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child Abuse", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Family Characteristics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Parent-Child Relations", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Surveys and Questionnaires", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Sidebotham P"}, {"clean": "Heron J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Child Abuse Negl", "volume": "30", "issue": "5"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "SETPC8XA", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1002607", "DOI_filename": "90a4406ebf3ddb6c441a5238120a0cac", "PMID": "22479202", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84859238629", "hash": "41379a3a515147d84ae03d453464d514"}, "clean": {"title": "Novel loci for adiponectin levels and their influence on type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits: a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of 45,891 individuals.", "abstract": "['Circulating levels of adiponectin, a hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are highly heritable and are inversely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and other metabolic traits.

The roles of parental and family characteristics in explaining any observed differences between maternal education and child height were investigated. Children whose mothers had the highest education compared to those with none or a basic level of education, were 0.39 cm longer at birth (95% CI: 0.30 to 0.48).

Results from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC) show that fetal growth is influenced by both fetal genes and maternal-uterine-placental factors. Important maternal-placental factors include parity, smoking and weight gain, but also maternal genetic factors in the mother or fetal placenta, including the mitochondrial DNA 16189 variant and H19. These maternal genetic factors particularly influence smaller, growth-restrained infants, as in first pregnancies. Fetal genes include the insulin gene (INS) VNTR (variable number of tandem repeat), which we recently confirmed to be associated with birth size and cord blood IGF-II levels; these fetal gene effects are more evident in the absence of maternal-uterine growth restraint. During postnatal life, the INS VNTR III/III genotype remains associated with body size, including body mass index and waist circumference, and also lower insulin sensitivity among girls. However, as at birth, significant gene-environment interactions are seen. Rapid 'catch-up' early postnatal weight gain follows maternal-uterine restraint, and strongly predicts later childhood obesity and insulin resistance; among these children, those with INS VNTR class I alleles are more obese. Genetic factors that influence early growth may have conferred some early survival advantage in human history during times of undernutrition. With abundant nutrition and rising obesity rates, these genetic factors and their interactions with maternal and childhood environmental factors that influence childhood growth may now contribute to the early development of adult disease risk.

Overall our findings provide little evidence that these established risk factors for schizophrenia show a similar relationship with PLIKS, suggesting that the presence of PLIKS is unlikely to be a strong marker of early expression of the pathology underlying schizophrenia. Whether future studies of PLIKS will increase our understanding of mechanisms underlying the development of schizophrenia, or prove useful in prediction of this disorder, remains to be seen.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Age Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child of Impaired Parents", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hallucinations", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Paternal Age", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Prevalence", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Psychotic Disorders", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Schizophrenia", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Zammit S"}, {"clean": "Horwood J"}, {"clean": "Thompson A"}, {"clean": "Thomas K"}, {"clean": "Menezes P"}, {"clean": "Gunnell D"}, {"clean": "Hollis C"}, {"clean": "Wolke D"}, {"clean": "Lewis G"}, {"clean": "Harrison G"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Schizophr.

Safety was stated by 45% of parents to be the most important factor to consider when buying a pesticide. When buying pesticide products, labels were stated to be the most important source of information about pesticides. However, a third of parents stated they would not follow the product label exactly when using a product, just under half felt labels were both inadequate and hard to understand, and about 10% of parents would not take notice of warnings on the pesticide label. Less than half of parents would use gloves when applying a pesticide, although the use of protective equipment such as gloves during the application of pesticides could greatly reduce the exposure.

Unfortunately, disorders involving these traits-specifically reading disability (RD) and language impairment (LI)-are common and prevent affected individuals from developing adequate communication skills, leaving them at risk for adverse academic, socioeconomic and psychiatric outcomes. Both RD and LI are complex traits that frequently co-occur, leading us to hypothesize that these disorders share genetic etiologies. To test this, we performed a genome-wide association study on individuals affected with both RD and LI in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The strongest associations were seen with markers in ZNF385D (OR = 1.81, P = 5.45 \u00d7 10(-7) ) and COL4A2 (OR = 1.71, P = 7.59 \u00d7 10(-7) ).

This case-control study is nested within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and included 269 cases with PPD and 276 controls matched on age group, parity, and presence or absence of depressive symptoms in pregnancy as assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. OXTR DNA methylation (CpG site -934) and genotype (rs53576 and rs2254298) were assayed from DNA extracted from blood collected during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of elevated symptoms of PPD with genotype, methylation, and their interaction adjusted for psychosocial factors (n = 500). There was evidence of an interaction between rs53576 and methylation in the OXTR gene amongst women who did not have depression prenatally but developed PPD (p interaction = 0.026, adjusted for covariates, n = 257).

A total of 3483 children in a birth cohort study participated in semistructured interviews for psychotic experiences at ages 12 and 18. We examined whether (1) a composite measure of risk for schizophrenia conferred by common alleles (polygenic score) was associated with psychotic experiences, (2) variants with genome-wide evidence for association with schizophrenia were associated with psychotic experiences, and (3) we could identify genetic variants for psychotic experiences using a genome-wide association (GWA) approach. We found no evidence that a schizophrenia polygenic score, or variants showing genome-wide evidence of association with schizophrenia, were associated with adolescent psychotic experiences within the general population. In fact, individuals who had a higher number of risk alleles for genome-wide hits for schizophrenia showed a decreased risk of psychotic experiences. In the GWA study, no variants showed GWA for psychotic experiences, and there was no evidence that the strongest hits (P &lt; 5 \u00d7 10(-5)) were enriched for variants associated with schizophrenia in large consortia. Although polygenic scores are weak tools for prediction of schizophrenia, they show strong evidence of association with this disorder. Our findings, however, lend little support to the hypothesis that psychotic experiences in population-based samples of adolescents share a comparable genetic architecture to schizophrenia, or that utilizing a broader and more common phenotype of psychotic experiences will be an efficient approach to increase understanding of the genetic etiology of schizophrenia.

This information was combined with census and geographical data in order to identify neighbourhood influences on accident risks and then attempt to explain these using multilevel regression modelling. A small but statistically significant amount of between-neighbourhood variance in accident risk was found, with neighbourhood intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.82% for any accident, and 0.84% for accidents resulting in injury requiring medical attention. This was entirely accounted for by a variety of child, parental and household level variables. Independent risk factors for both outcomes were children who were developmentally more advanced or displayed greater conduct and behavioural problems, mothers who were of younger age, who were without work, who were smokers, whose partners were unemployed or drank alcohol excessively, and households in which there had recently been adverse life events, or which were under financial stress. The mother's perceptions of neighbourhood quality also explained some of the risks for any accident, but not for medically attended accidents, and this was a variable that operated at the level of individual households rather than at the level of neighbourhoods. The implications of this study are that differences in accident risk between neighbourhoods are explained by geographical clustering of similar types of children, families and households.

This study consists of 10,937 infants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) born between April 1991 and December 1992 in the southwest of England. Infant temperament at 6 months of age was reported by parents using the adapted RITQ. Responses were scored according to the RITQ manual and then categorized into temperament groups (easy, intermediate low, intermediate high, and difficult) using either the RITQ norms or norms derived from the data. The scores for each temperament subscale and the proportion of children in each temperament group were compared across the two methods. Subscale scores for the ALSPAC sample were higher (more \"difficult\") than the RITQ norms for rhythmicity, approach, adaptability, intensity, and distractibility. When RITQ norms were applied, 24% infants were categorized as difficult and 25% as easy, compared with 15% difficult and 38% easy when ALSPAC norms were used. There are discrepancies between RITQ norms and the ALSPAC norms which resulted in differences in the distribution of temperament groups.

Using low-coverage sequence data from 10,442 Chinese women to compute the normalized numbers of reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome as a proxy for the amount of mtDNA, we identified two loci that contribute to mtDNA levels: one within the TFAM gene on chromosome 10 (rs11006126, p value = 8.73 \u00d7 10(-28), variance explained = 1.90%) and one over the CDK6 gene on chromosome 7 (rs445, p value = 6.03 \u00d7 10(-16), variance explained = 0.50%). Both loci replicated in an independent cohort. CDK6 is thus a new molecule involved in the control of mtDNA. We identify increased rates of heteroplasmy in women with MDD, and show from an experimental paradigm using mice that the increase is likely due to stress. Furthermore, at least one heteroplasmic variant is significantly associated with changes in the amount of mtDNA (position 513, p value = 3.27 \u00d7 10(-9), variance explained = 0.48%) suggesting site-specific heteroplasmy as a possible link between stress and increase in amount of mtDNA.

Type 2 diabetes genes may influence birth weight through maternal genotype, by increasing maternal glycemia in pregnancy, or through fetal genotype, by altering fetal insulin secretion. We aimed to assess the role of the recently described type 2 diabetes gene TCF7L2 in birth weight. We genotyped the polymorphism rs7903146 in 15,709 individuals whose birth weight was available from six studies and in 8,344 mothers from three studies.

Stratification by fetal genotype suggested that the association was driven by maternal genotype (31-g [95% CI 9-48 g] increase per allele; corrected P=.003). Analysis of diabetes-related traits in 10,314 nondiabetic individuals suggested the most likely mechanism is that the risk allele reduces maternal insulin secretion (disposition index reduced by ~0.15 standard deviation; P=1x10-4), which results in increased maternal glycemia in pregnancy and hence increased offspring birth weight.

There are, however, methodological challenges in establishing robust causal links, since exposures often act many decades before outcomes of interest, and may also be strongly related to other factors, generating considerable degrees of potential confounding. With respect to pre-natal factors, the degree of confounding can sometimes be estimated by comparing the association between exposures experienced by the mother during pregnancy and outcomes among the offspring with the association of the same exposures experienced by the father during the pregnancy period and offspring outcomes. If the effects are due to an intra-uterine exposure, then maternal exposure during pregnancy should have a clearly greater influence than paternal exposure. If confounding by socio-economic, behavioural or genetic factors generates the association then maternal and paternal pregnancy exposures will be related in the same way with the outcome. For early life exposures it is also possible to compare outcomes in siblings who are concordant or discordant for the exposure, which will reduce the influence of family-level confounding factors. A different approach is that of Mendelian randomization, which utilises genetic variants of known effect that can proxy for modifiable exposures and are also not in general related to potential confounding factors, or influenced by disease. In other settings the use of non-genetic instrumental variables is possible. A series of examples of the application of these approaches are presented and their potentials and limitations discussed. Other epidemiological strategies are briefly reviewed.

Rare mutations of GCK cause fasting hyperglycemia and alter birth weight. The extent to which common variation of GCK explains normal variation of fasting glucose and birth weight is not known. We aimed to comprehensively define the role of variation of GCK in determination of fasting glucose and birth weight, using a tagging SNP (tSNP) approach and studying 19,806 subjects from six population-based studies. Using 22 tSNPs, we showed that the variant rs1799884 is associated with fasting glucose at all ages in the normal population and exceeded genomewide levels of significance (P=10-9). rs3757840 was also highly significantly associated with fasting glucose (P=8x10-7), but haplotype analysis revealed that this is explained by linkage disequilibrium (r2=0.2) with rs1799884. A maternal A allele at rs1799884 was associated with a 32-g (95% confidence interval 11-53 g) increase in offspring birth weight (P=.002).

Earlier and faster maturation predicted delinquency in boys and girls. Spare time activities partially mediated these links such that early maturing girls more often engaged in hanging out outside, which placed them at greater risk for delinquency. In addition, compared to their later and slower maturing counterparts, boys who matured earlier and faster were less likely to engage in sports/games, a spare time activity type that is linked to lower delinquency risk.

A total of 2692 children had full data. One hundred ninety-three (7.2%) reported at least one fracture over the 2-yr follow-up period.

Comparing the genome scan and candidate gene approaches, the former makes fewer assumptions at the genetic level or about mechanism but has greater statistical difficulties while the latter partially solves the statistical problem but makes more assumptions at both genetic and mechanistic levels. Among current difficulties is a lack of information about the nature of gene variant/phenotype associations: the frequency with which different classes of gene or sequence are involved; the type of genetic variation most commonly involved; the appropriate genetic models to apply to analysis. The overarching problem is that of multiple testing, one solution to which is to integrate genetic information to create a smaller number of compound variables. At the other end of the scale, decisions about the level of complexity at which to pitch the identification of phenotypes also affect the multiple testing problem: whether to pitch them at the level of disease outcomes, or at any of the multiple levels of intermediate phenotypes or traits. The third issue is how best to deal with gene/gene or gene/environment interactions, or whether to ignore them. Only as more genotype/phenotype associations emerge, by whatever means, will the numbers of results allow these questions to be answered. We describe here a new approach to genotype/phenotype association studies, the phenome scan, in which dense phenotypic information in human cohorts is scanned for associations with individual genetic variants.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between fat intake as a percentage of energy, and nutrient adequacy, growth, blood lipids, and iron status in 18- and 43-month-old children.', 'This study forms part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)-a geographically-based cohort study in southwest England. A randomly selected subsample of the ALSPAC cohort attended research clinics approximately every 6 months from birth, at which a variety of anthropometric and other measurements were made. Dietary intakes at 18 and 43 months were assessed using a 3-day unweighed food record. A capillary blood sample was taken at 18 months for measurement of hemoglobin and ferritin levels. Nonfasting venous blood samples were taken at 31 and 43 months and analyzed for total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The children were divided into quartiles of fat intake as a percentage of energy (QFI). QFI groups were compared for the number of children reaching recommended nutrient intakes, and for anthropometry, measures of iron status, and blood lipid levels.', 'Nine hundred fifty-one children at 18 months and 805 children at 43 months.', 'The mean (standard deviation) percentages of energy from fat in each quartile at 18 months were 31.2 (2.8), 36.1 (0.9), 39.1 (0.8), and 43.1 (2.2), corresponding to a fat intake in grams of 37.3 (8.1), 44.3 (8.1), 50.4 (10.2), and 55.4 (12.7). The number of children failing to reach recommended intake levels for zinc and vitamin A fell with increasing fat intake, while the number of children consuming less than the recommendations for iron and vitamin C rose at both ages. Despite this, there was no association between fat intake at 18 months and mean height or body mass index (BMI) at either 18 or 31 months. Fat intake at 43 months was also unassociated with concurrent or subsequent height or BMI. There was also no significant increase in the number of children falling below the tenth percentile for height or BMI as QFI fell. Mean ferritin levels at 18 months fell in both sexes as QFI increased. Total cholesterol levels at 31 months were significantly associated with QFI at 18 months, and rose from 3.99 mmol/l in the lowest QFI in boys, to 4.31 mmol/l in the highest QFI. QFI at 43 months was unassociated with cholesterol levels.', 'These data do not suggest that fat intakes are an important determinant of growth in these children, even before the age of 2 years, or that children at the bottom of the range of fat intakes are experiencing delayed growth. On the other hand, there is also no evidence in this study that children on higher fat intakes are at a greater risk of becoming obese. In contrast to a number of US studies, we have not found children on lower fat intakes to have lower iron intakes-indeed higher fat intakes were associated with a greater chance of consuming less than the recommended intake of iron and with lower ferritin levels. The association of higher fat intakes with higher total cholesterol levels among boys is of concern, as there is evidence that the process of atherosclerosis begins during the preschool years.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Age Distribution", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Anthropometry", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Body Height", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Body Mass Index", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cholesterol", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cholesterol, HDL", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Dietary Fats", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Ferritins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Growth", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hemoglobins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Lipids", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sex Distribution", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Rogers I"}, {"clean": "Emmett P"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Pediatrics", "volume": "108", "issue": "3"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "Y856G3SZ", "DOI": "10.1017/S0033291704004015", "DOI_filename": "4dfb846f121942183dbbf969287e48cd", "PMID": "15918348", "scopus": "2-s2.0-19144372742", "hash": "557c18383aea63c6db9d1ade8a47c893"}, "clean": {"title": "Factors moderating change in depressive symptoms in women following separation: findings from a community study in England.", "abstract": "['Previous studies suggest that separation is a major stressful life event that is linked with marked increases in depressive symptoms.

An issue in such studies is that phenotypes are often measured by different instruments across study cohorts, requiring harmonization of measures so that more powerful fixed effect meta-analyses can be employed. Within the Genetics of Personality Consortium, we demonstrate for two clinically relevant personality traits, Neuroticism and Extraversion, how Item-Response Theory (IRT) can be applied to map item data from different inventories to the same underlying constructs. Personality item data were analyzed in &gt;160,000 individuals from 23 cohorts across Europe, USA and Australia in which Neuroticism and Extraversion were assessed by nine different personality inventories. Results showed that harmonization was very successful for most personality inventories and moderately successful for some. Neuroticism and Extraversion inventories were largely measurement invariant across cohorts, in particular when comparing cohorts from countries where the same language is spoken. The IRT-based scores for Neuroticism and Extraversion were heritable (48 and 49 %, respectively, based on a meta-analysis of six twin cohorts, total N = 29,496 and 29,501 twin pairs, respectively) with a significant part of the heritability due to non-additive genetic factors. For Extraversion, these genetic factors qualitatively differ across sexes. We showed that our IRT method can lead to a large increase in sample size and therefore statistical power.

We applied an innovative method in which we tested for the effect of groups of genes defined according to cellular function (functional gene group analysis). Using an initial sample of 627 subjects, this functional gene group analysis detected that synaptic heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) play an important role in cognitive ability (P(EMP) = 1.9 x 10(-4)). The association with heterotrimeric G proteins was validated in an independent population sample of 1507 subjects. Heterotrimeric G proteins are central relay factors between the activation of plasma membrane receptors by extracellular ligands and the cellular responses that these induce, and they can be considered a point of convergence, or a \"signaling bottleneck.\" Although alterations in synaptic signaling processes may not be the exclusive explanation for the association of heterotrimeric G proteins with cognitive ability, such alterations may prominently affect the properties of neuronal networks in the brain in such a manner that impaired cognitive ability and lower intelligence are observed. The reported association of synaptic heterotrimeric G proteins with cognitive ability clearly points to a new direction in the study of the genetic basis of cognitive ability.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cognition", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Databases, Genetic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetics, Population", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Intelligence Tests", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Quality Control", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Reproducibility of Results", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Synapses", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Ruano D"}, {"clean": "Abecasis G"}, {"clean": "Glaser B"}, {"clean": "Lips E"}, {"clean": "Cornelisse L"}, {"clean": "de Jong A"}, {"clean": "Evans D"}, {"clean": "Davey Smith G"}, {"clean": "Timpson N"}, {"clean": "Smit A"}, {"clean": "Heutink P"}, {"clean": "Verhage M"}, {"clean": "Posthuma D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Am.

An additional analysis of pair-wise connections showed no evidence of differences in individuals with PEs. These results are consistent with previous findings in schizophrenia. Reduced efficiency in critical core hubs suggests the brains of individuals with PEs may be particularly predisposed to dysfunction.

We report the results of a genome-wide association study of SLI which included parent-of-origin effects and child genotype effects and used 278 families of language-impaired children. The child genotype effects analysis did not identify significant associations. We found genome-wide significant paternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 14q12 (P = 3.74 \u00d7 10(-8)) and suggestive maternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 5p13 (P = 1.16 \u00d7 10(-7)). A subsequent targeted association of six single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 5 in 313 language-impaired individuals and their mothers from the ALSPAC cohort replicated the maternal effects, albeit in the opposite direction (P = 0.001); as fathers' genotypes were not available in the ALSPAC study, the replication analysis did not include paternal parent-of-origin effects. The paternally-associated SNP on chromosome 14 yields a non-synonymous coding change within the NOP9 gene. This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that has been reported to be significantly dysregulated in individuals with schizophrenia. The region of maternal association on chromosome 5 falls between the PTGER4 and DAB2 genes, in a region previously implicated in autism and ADHD. The top SNP in this association locus is a potential expression QTL of ARHGEF19 (also called WGEF) on chromosome 1. Members of this protein family have been implicated in intellectual disability. In summary, this study implicates parent-of-origin effects in language impairment, and adds an interesting new dimension to the emerging picture of shared genetic etiology across various neurodevelopmental disorders.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Apraxias", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Chromosomes, Human", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genomic Imprinting", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genotype", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Quantitative Trait Loci", "major": "N"}, {"term": "RNA-Binding Proteins", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP4 Subtype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Nudel R"}, {"clean": "Simpson N"}, {"clean": "Baird G"}, {"clean": "O'Hare A"}, {"clean": "Conti-Ramsden G"}, {"clean": "Bolton P"}, {"clean": "Hennessy E"}, {"clean": "Ring S"}, {"clean": "Davey Smith G"}, {"clean": "Francks C"}, {"clean": "Paracchini S"}, {"clean": "Monaco A"}, {"clean": "Fisher S"}, {"clean": "Newbury D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Genes Brain Behav.", "volume": "13", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "ZZAU32MP", "DOI": "10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-205643", "DOI_filename": "1a39b7f9d5e6b80c45291f94f00c0b9b", "PMID": "25169729", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84907698991", "hash": "3334dcfdc9afebad3a31ae7bd4079719"}, "clean": {"title": "Ankylosing spondylitis is associated with the anthrax toxin receptor 2 gene (ANTXR2).", "abstract": "['ANTXR2 variants have been associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (p\u223c9\u00d710(-8)).
